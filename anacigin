Are you really implying we return to those times or anywhere near that political environment?  If so, you won't have much luck selling the American people on that governance concept without ushering in American Revolution 2.0.
This will end up fucking poor people. Low paying jobs will exclusively hire HS students.
What did you get a degree in and what is your trade that a part time baby sitter makes more than you?
There's no danger of that happening since Barack Obama ran for President and won *twice* on many of Bernie's policy positions.  Obama's mistake was in abandoning those campaign commitments.  Had Obama stuck to his campaign commitments, Democrats would not have lost control of Congress and he would have achieved far more than he did. 
I think "majority in the House and the Senate" is a pretty good way of describing the Republican party.

Mostly the same way that heterosexual couples benefit society.  And it's not like the government examines each and every prospective marriage to see if it would benefit society. Do you *really* assume that every single heterosexual marriage benefits society more than every homosexual marriage? Even ones that involve a Kardashian?

It's important to distinguish between PAC and individual contributions when looking at a table like this. PACs are the company; individuals are people who happen to work for the company.
He literally just announced his campaign. Today. 
What do you think a socialist is, exactly? You sound like the one believing silly things.
That's precisely why Democrats don't want to fix it.  They know that it essentially gives them de facto amnesty.  They expand the government and expand their voter rolls.  Win-win.  
How in the hell could anyone think I would be advocating that? I was pointing out the inaccuracy of a claim made by the person I responded to.
Why should the US care how the left-right divide compares to the Europe? Europeans don't elect the US government, Americans do. This would only be relevant if we were discussing the election of a world government.
&gt; Actually, Bernie's donations are nearly all from the unions' PACs, NOT from individuals.  This is 100% untrue, that is his top donor list, as in the top dollar amount donations.  [The majority of his donations are from individuals](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00000528&amp;cycle=Career) (84% actually)  and they are almost exclusively under $100 each.  The Union PACs are also composed of individuals.  Also for the record, on Union PACs  **It is unlawful for a labor union to take money from your paycheck for contributions to a federal PAC or for the federal PAC to accept such contributions without your written authorization.**  Every person who is contributing money in the PAC needs to authorize the money first, they have a choice. 
While I love Bernie, a GOP president would be infinitely worse on ALL important issues than clinton. Let's keep it real here.

I disagree that those sentences were ignored.  So does the Supreme Court.  Said I would drop it though.  Was just curious in what you thought.
OK I am pretty sure you are trolling me, but I'll play along. The very link you provided said "The Finnish-built Shokalskiy left the port of Bluff in New Zealand on 8 December with 48 passengers and 20 crew members to follow in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorer and scientist Douglas Mawson. Led by the climate scientist Chris Turney of the University of New South Wales, the ship has been sailing through the Southern Ocean, repeating and extending many of Mawson's wildlife and weather observations in order to build a picture of how this part of the world has changed in the past 100 years."  I don't know where you get "These were climate scientists going out to document how all the sea ice was disappearing." But its just ridiculous.   If you are being sincere, I recommend learning how NASA measures  ice levels in Antartica. Its very interesting.   http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-begins-sixth-year-of-airborne-antarctic-ice-change-study-0/#.VULIYCFVhBc  http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/#.VULIYyFVhBc  http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/science/index.html#.VULIrSFVhBc
Can we stop the bullshit about higher min wage is bad and we're taxed too much?  Denmark literally pays people 20+ dollars an hour has free education free healthcare and a higher standard of living than we do.  Our tax burden is like 32% to their 38%, it's just getting beyond old.  A single payer system is cheaper than what we have in every way possible.  
&gt;Ah but now you dropped solely, you are saying something different now. Work your shit out.  You aren't comprehending. Solely not being the only 'trait' in the law, but solely meaning that an employer can't fire you "solely" because of your sexual orientation (along with other protected immutable traits).   &gt;I'm bisexual and currently dating a guy and if anything it affected work more when I was dating a female.  Cool.  http://www.bna.com/lgbt-minorities-face-high-unemployment-job-discrimination-low-wages-study-finds/  &gt;So the US passed straight/white/majority discrimination laws?  You don't seem to be understanding this point. It adds sexual orientation as a protected class (in certain respects). Heterosexuality is a sexual orientation.   &gt;See the problem here is "cause of action". What is that? What does that entail?  It entitles you to file a legal complaint. It will be dropped if it has no merit and you will be charged a lot of money in attorney and filing fees. 
....and as if to prove my point...  The Federalist LOL.     If you go any further to the right, you'd fall over the edge of your flat earth.  (Tell yer Buddy Ted Cruz I said hello while yer there)  In the meantime:  **Clinton Foundation Expenses**  * 88.4% - Programs  * 7% - Management and General Expenses  * 4.6% - Fundraising   BTW - Their accounting is done by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and then audited by BKD.  Two of the largest accounting firms in the US.  But who are you going to believe?
good
You can't really fault her for receiving donations though. What is she gonna do, turn them down?
You are crazy if you think nothing will have progress.  I'm sorry your poster boy won't win the nomination.
Regardless of who either party puts up the choices are going to suck.
We have to expect dead hookers and child porn. Lots of dead hookers and child porn. Brace yourself America. The piles of dead hookers and child porn is coming.
I'm left of center, thank you for your assumption that I enjoy Ted Cruz and his loony theocratic ideas. I used the article for it's direct sources to the Clinton Foundation's tax returns. And as for how great those accounting firms are, they are [refiling their tax returns](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-usa-election-clinton-taxes-exclusive-idUSKBN0NE0CA20150423) for the last **5 years** due to "misreporting" it's list of donors. Great accounting.  Where's your sources, bud?
Next up, ban all medical care in order to prevent abortions
Seriously? you want him to not cannabalize clinton just because it may help the fucking republicans? what the fuck is wrong with you/
I can't get over "Women have always been the primary victims of war." Either it's something she actually believes, in which case "unelectable" is the least of things I have to say about her, or she was only telling a specific group of completely BATSHIT INSANE people what she thought they wanted to hear. The latter is slimy lying politicking, that when combined with her immense corporate funding paints a very bleak picture of a corporate interests puppet who will say anything to get elected but once you're in, you're in. The other implies that she believes men are (and always have been) the secondary victims of war. Which is fine, if you're a *Portlandia* sketch. Less fine if you're a senator who voted for the Iraq War.  I mean, she voted for the Iraq War and publicly shat on all veterans living AND dead, either way. She will never get my vote, and if Sanders isn't on the ballot I'm staying the fuck home.
Minimum wages higher than 50% of median wages are known to reduce total employment.  That's based on emipirical evidence that /politics refuses to acknowledge.  Danish citizens do not get anything for free.  They spend about 55% of GDP through government, not 38% like you claim.  The effective middle class tax rates are between 40% and 60% there and cost of living is higher.  Sanders single player plan places a 13.4% payroll tax on the working class.  Low income people currently pay 0% for Medicaid.
There are not always two sides to an argument.
...that's not what execution means.
The difference is the donors.  Look at Bernie's Opensecrets.org page,his top donors are unions, not banks like Hillary and Obama.  https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00000528&amp;cycle=2014 
Have you ever even attempted to get on medicaid? I'm guessing not.  Good luck with that, and it's very limited.  Even if he were to tax 13.4% more the working class would end up saving money.  We're still paying a lot of money for healthcare plans.   The cost of living in Denmark isn't that much higher, if you compare cost of living there to the US they still come out on top and even the lowest workers make more money.  This delusion that our tax system is OK and we're fine is getting stupid.  We have some of the worst public healthcare in the western world, and we're spending twice as much as everyone else.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/04/18/higher-or-lower-how-do-you-think-your-u-s-tax-burden-compares-to-other-countries/
It's like flying. You just have to believe.
So, "I'm left of center, therefore I am quoting some far-right talking points from the tea party".  Yeah, okay.  Why not infowars next time?   And just for the record, the Foundation isn't legally required to list a single donor if they don't want to.  They hire the best accounting firms, then hire an auditor to check them, then publish it all online for anyone who wants to see.  Most of their tax forms  are over 25 pages.  Re-filing tax statements on a Foundation that deals in hundreds of millions of dollars is not really unusual at all.  All you actually need to do is PROVE they've done something illegal and we can end this right here --- you win.  In the meantime all you have is your right wing talking points and innuendos.

Surely you can muster up a better response than an ad hominem? On the same ground, we can dismiss all the other comments, as Reddit is completely unbiased and definitely has no special preference for Bernie Sanders.
To be fair, it was hilarious.

Well of course, some form of governance must exist.  And true, America was emancipated from British rule by rich land owners; but don't forget said power was also relinquished after the revolution. Washington had a chance to become king and gave it up for the ideals he believed in. So it wasn't like he and the other founding fathers were looking for anything other than freedom from the crown.  Regarding your last thought, I'd love to believe it were possible, but it's very unlikely. Governments rule with laws, usually there are laws against treason to protect the ruling individuals from possible revolt, these laws individually suppress those people wanting change until there are more people wanting change than can be suppressed; this is when judicial law is tossed and martial law is enacted, further suppressing the dissenters. Peaceful revolution requires cooperation between those ruling and the citizens, and far too often those ruling have too much to lose to give it up willingly, which is what forces the citizenship to use other means.
I mean, you could see that that's kind of an important part of the definition and virtually nothing differentiates it from "kill" then, does it?  Except for the shrill emotional argument it inspires, which is why you use it.
Yeah but what about cousin marriage licenses?   Alabama ain't getting serious about getting rid of marriage licenses until they go after cousin marriage licenses! 
&gt; I don't believe for one fucking second that Hillary Clinton will do anything to fight income inequality if she's elected. She and her husband are both multimillionaires.   Both her and her husband are "self made", which means they started off in the middle class. Unlike someone like Romney, who had everything spoon fed to him in life, both of them had to work to get where they are. They understand the plight of the middle class and have both spend their careers addressing the issue. You have literally no evidence about anything to the contrary it's just guesswork because she's been in Washington forever and it's a talking point of the radical left.  &gt; Hillary Clinton is a republican in disguise.  This is the most absurd statement ever. She's certainly more moderate than Sanders, but has done QUITE a bit to help the liberal agenda during her tenure. Her stance on economic issues has been fairly consistent throughout her career and she's been an advocate of the middle class since she was First Lady WAY WAY WAY back when. However, it's not worth spending the time to demonstrate this too you because, 1, much of this information is in my above comment, and 2, you definitely won't care about the facts.  I suppose Obama and Bill Clinton are both Republicans too in your mind...
[deleted]
Choosing a lesser evil is inevitable.  A "capable" candidate is risky.  A sure-win is what we need.  Edit:  And Sanders is never ever going to be a sure win.
[deleted]
Or, you know, video. But hey, that camera must have been rigged to show cops treating a man with a broken spine with unnecessary force.
Who cares about Clinton.  Sanders has a better record.
I don't have to believe Rand Paul. My sources are Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the platform of the Democratic party. 
Wouldn't they be playing other tools if they did?
they could assemble, just not in the street to block traffic.
Except there is a cost to this sometimes. For years the Democrats kept putting who they wanted to up for election, regardless of elect-ability. The result was CRUSHING DEFEATS except for the Watergate inspired single term of Carter. Here's some electoral vote numbers:   - 1968: Nixon 301, Humphrey 191, Wallace 46  - 1972: Nixon 520, McGovern 17 (McGovern won a SINGLE STATE and DC.)  - 1976: Carter 297, Ford (the guy who pardoned Nixon) 240.   - 1980: Reagan 489, Carter 49  - 1984: Reagan 525, Mondale 13  - 1988: Bush 426, Dukakis 111  And then, for the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat was elected twice as as president: William J. Clinton.   So yes, I get it, all you idealists can't stand us moderate, pro business, pro gun, culture war wishy washy Democrats. But at least our candidates don't get obliterated. All those liberals that kept winning the nomination, just allowed a Republican to have a super mandate to do what they want. It's time to be a grown up, and realize that if you want Bernie Sanders (or someone like him) to be president, you have to first convince the country to agree with his stances LONG LONG before it's election time. It's like showing up the day of the final exam saying "if we just study hard enough in the next 15 minutes, we might pass." No...you won't. 
Very funny. A self-described socialist is totally "centrist". You people desperately need some fresh air and perspective.
Paul has a lot less of the young republican/moderate vote than you think.  He's been saying a lot of truly far right wing nonsense, and that baggage is hurting him a lot.  He does a good job of pretending to be in favor of libertarian stuff, but his extremist anti-choice stuff, his pandering to militia and white nationalists, etc adds up to younger people just not trusting him much.  It's the problem of the internet age, he can't say one thing to one audience, and a different thing to a different audience.  But he tries.  He tries his best to sell his libertarian lite crap to the younger audience while going full bore Ron Paul far right wing extremist with the older voters, and the contrast shows him to be unpalatable to the younger folks and the older folks both.  I'm dubious about him holding his Senate seat, he certainly won't get the Republican nomination.

Except that "special consideration" in this case is simply "ex parte communication" not "does whatever they want."
And constituents aren't always voters.  And voters aren't always people who voted for that candidate.  Is it really that difficult to parse this out and say "huh, it's probably true that Bernie Sanders isn't responsive to the most conservative voters in Vermont"?  Because last I checked, that person would also be a constituent.
Roberts thinks money = speech outside of the hearing of the judge. Generally you only need two other monkeys to go along with that to block out the truth and he has four.
Last article I read there were two other guys in the van that said they heard banging.   One said he didnt know the other said it sounded like he was trying to hurt himself. 
It is one of the obligations for our elected officials to enact legislation for the welfare of the people. The issue is complicated, yes, but that does not mean that they are incapable of making legislation to address it, or that an answer to the moral problem does not exist. 
That is probably the most ignorant thing I've read in Reddit all day. Voting based solely on party lines goes against every single thing that Bernie Sanders stands for. I'm sure he'd rather see Ron Paul than Hillary in office.
You could write a fucking book on all the problems and implications of needing a victim to be perfect before caring about the underlying injustices of their death.
I worked minimum wage for many years and I lived.... working my ass off my way thru college, so I could gain the motivation to finish knowing I would never have to live like that again.
This has been an issue for years, the foundation was getting big contributions and her hubby was getting huge speaking fees from individuals and corporations that stood to benefit from decisions being made by the state department when she was running the show.  That's about as blatant as you can get, and she is rightfully going to get hammered for it.
No its not clear. Only people who pull shit out of their ass are "certain" that Bernie will lose. Because let's all remember it was so "certain" Hillary would win in 2008 against Obama. He has a real chance as the ONLY other Dem in the race right now. If you want Bernie to win, get off your ass like the rest of us and make this thing possible. At the very least though, stop spouting this cynical BS. Its comments like yours that make people more apathetic and we all know that voter apathy is real problem already.
Ok, I disagree. 
I honestly don't care, I don't trust anyone that shills for Hillary.
&gt;But the other choice is exactly "no code of conduct for US corporations abroad."  Well, no.  There's a whole spectrum of options between "nothing" and "whatever Sanders believes in, but I have no idea what that is."  &gt;The opposition gives no fucks about that issue. Sanders is putting a spotlight on it.  You seem to have mistaken my point for "I'm a Republican."  I'm not.  I'm a registered Democrat and have been for my entire adult life.  What I'm reacting to is the constant circle-jerk of how awesome Sanders' *plans* are.  I haven't seen a single plan.  I've seen rhetoric, I've seen broad goals, I haven't seen a *plan*.  And speaking as someone with a background in public policy, the plan is the important part.  Because *no one* disagrees with a statement like "we need to make college affordable."  The disagreement is over *how* we do that.

The Pendulum does occasionally stutter.  The analogy makes sense when you look at it very broadly, when you delve into the nitty gritty it becomes more like a stuttering clock hand that runs backwards occasionally, but still generally goes in one direction.  Remember, Clinton was not that far off from a Republican. He even referred to himself as an "Eisenhower Republican"
Is it though? You can read almost any scholarly paper/article on the income inequality in the USA and see the truth in a statement suggesting the rich are disproportionately benefiting from economic growth today. I mean standard of living-wise, we know that working class Americans are making less money (when adjusted for cost of living and inflation) than they did 15-20 years ago. That's simply a fact.  No, raising the minimum wage is not all he has. The man wants to rebuild our infrastructure. He wants to actually fund our public schools and stop depriving schools of their budgets. He wants pay equality for women. He wants to fix campaign financing laws and the citizens united ruling (he would get to pick supreme court justices if they retire too, so this would most certainly make this more realistic). He wants to end our wars in the middle east. He wants to roll back NSA programs and stop the surveillance of Americans. He wants to save our environment. He wants Wall Street to pay for their crimes. The man is a progressive, and the only true progressive you will see in this race. Hillary has been bought like the rest of the Republican candidates (most of the Dem's too) and she doesn't believe in what she says. Bernie means everything he says and will follow through with his promises the best he can. His voting record and campaign donation record show this. I will be voting for Bernie this upcoming election, and I strongly encourage you to vote for him too.
Interned for a republican Congressman and did not get paid. This is not universally true, so stop spreading bullshit.
  &gt;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way.
Except it wouldn't because she IS a republican, who says she's a democrat. 
And when she wins she will do none of them, just like every president that wins.
Jobs will just keep raising the bar on how much experience they want before they hire you until you are working as an unpaid intern for multiple years...oh wait that is already happening.
Primary candidate: "Look how far to the left/right I am! I plan to shake things up and change everything. 0% taxes. World Peace. Bigger penises. Just you wait..."  Election candidate: "Hi, look how close to the center I am. I love dogs and babies. Wait, I'm hearing from one of my advisers that Ohio doesn't like dogs very much. Now I think dogs are just okay, but I still love babies. And god. AND AMERICA!"
did you seriously report lol
38 Democrats, 1 Republican, and 1 Independent (Sanders) voted to ban the most popular rifle in America less than 2 years ago.  I wouldn't fully call it "funny."  That's the vast majority of the Democratic party in the Senate voting to deal a HUGE blow to the right to bear arms.  It's one thing to ban niche weapons used only by criminal elements, it's another to ban extremely common firearms that are popular among peaceful law-abiding citizens, which is what 38 Democrats (and 1 Republican) tried to do.  Reagan isn't a  politician anymore, but his opponent, Carter, wanted to ban all semi-automatic firearms . . . which are the vast majority of firearms sold today.  Carter also wanted to ban all inexpensive guns, effectively stripping away the right to bear arms from those who were poor.  Bush Sr. also isn't a politician anymore.  To be fair to the NRA, it's not like their partisanship causes them to pick the more anti-gun candidate over the pro-gun candidate, they just sometimes are fighting a losing battle (like in the 80s and 90s).
I hate to break it to you but it's not the janitors at the back donating to Hillary. They don't make more if banks to well. They make more if unions have any kind of sway in dc
We can't. Which is why I'm confused why people are so excited about Bernie like he's the second coming, people felt the same about Obama in 2008z
Don't misunderstand me, I hope he wins, however, this country is not progressive enough to elect a jewish man over a seemingly reliable republican. It's just not. I wish it were, but Sanders does not have much of a chance. 
Exactly. Let's stop being bullied into electing crooks like Hillary.
Clinton is a pancake as well. Oh well. Weekend at Bernie's 2016?
Give me a break... Sanders is not Obama and this isn't 2008.   
Because there's a chance of change. Obama lying doesn't mean bernie will. 
[deleted]
Yes, but your implication was that other politician's views were worth believing in the same way Sanders' are,  which is not objectively true when you compare him to a climate change denier or something similar. It might subjectively be the same, but it's just not the *same*.  But that's probably not what you really meant and I'm splitting hairs so I'll shut the fuck up. 
Yeah, we shouldn't really be giving Bill a "third term" anyway. It's just not in the spirit of the constitution and the founding fathers to allow a former president that kind of influence over the presidency.
And Matt has known him his whole life? Look I'm sure Bernie is an honest guy but this *always* thing is hyperbolic BS, if you want to criticize her fire away but be specific. 
BFD.
As a what I consider to be a Reagan republican (progressive on most social issues, hate government snooping, want smaller government... Maybe I'm independent?), let me just say that it's nice to see the Dems pulled to the fringes as well. Makes things interesting...
Ah, the purity of the true believer redditors! Whenever I want to remember how eternally clueless I was in another time I read the comments in /r/politics. For every thousand sage comments you'll find one person who will hit the streets and knock on doors, because they think it's all done on the Internet.  I don't care how purely your fire burns for Sanders, he has as much chance of winning as a fart in a hurricane.
One could if the federal government didn't flood the student loan market causing tuition to sky rocket past inflation.
&gt;I feel like most problems can be dealt with on a private level, roommates do so all the time.  Roommates and marriages are *nothing* alike! Not going to bother checking off how; it should be obvious.  &gt;In the end its an individual's responsibility to protect their financial security.  Why would anyone want to get married if they're individuals first? Do you think everyone would create loophole-free contracts? Do think everyone would be completely honest about their assets or update their contracts to reflect familial/financial changes? Many would, but enough people would "just in case" the shit out of that thing in the beginning and never touch it again. A lot of people get screwed over and then marriage has a stigma. Fewer and fewer men have confidence in the idea of marriage with today's divorce laws heavily favoring women. Personal contracts would do the same thing after enough stories made headlines.  The state gets involved because marriage is good for economies, societies, and people. Things are better for everyone if people are settling down, raising families, and building communities. There are plenty examples in the world of what happens with broken families, unsupervised children, and no sense of community. So, of course the state wants in; makes their job easier and more lucrative.  I mostly agree with the idea of what you're saying, but I think you're giving those ideas far too much credit for how they would play out in practice. Don't get me wrong: I think 50/50 splits are seldom right or justified, but I also think a certain level of support (never for a lifetime) is reasonable in many cases. I would go on, but this is already way longer than I intended.
&gt;Bernie is an older white man, something conservatives can't see as evil.  Bernie is an admitted socialist, something conservatives universally see as evil. Fact.   I like him too but seriously...
&gt; working class Americans are making less money (when adjusted for cost of living and inflation) than they did 15-20 years ago. That's simply a fact.  NO, you're wrong. Try 40 years, as in since 1976.
And as long as there are Christians in America, he will not succeed in becoming president.  I'd vote for him, but he is strongly against EVERYTHING they are for, and strongly for EVERYTHING they are against.   Sadly, they make up the majority of voters. There's no possible way he can get elected. 
Probably not. Last guy to get her into the white house had to get that from someone else.
Its kind of funny because we can watch it happen. I mean seriously, there should be a subreddit dedicated to people betting on what kind of ways they will choose to bring him down to their level.

&gt;The Democratic Party strongly and equivocally supports ... a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of the ability to pay. **We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.**  There is no other reasonable way to interpret that. If you want further confirmation of what they mean just look to what Debbie Wasserman Schultz recently said in response to Rand Paul's question about a 7 pound baby.

Fox News gets Bernies kids eating right out of their hands on day one.  This is going to be good.  Yeah, a non profit NGO that sets up sustainable agriculture, clean water, and AIDS clinics, and publishes every filing online for the public to see - is exactly the same thing as the Koch bros. giving a billion dollars of unregulated, untraceable money to political campaigns.    
I'm still not seeing any reason why the govt should get involved.  Just because something is hard to do right and requires some awkward moments and forethought at the beginning of a cohabitation doesn't mean we should do it incorrectly and rely on the govt to pick up the pieces.  Nothing would change about the attitude of community, the social idea of marriage, or importance of the family group.  All that would be different is the government would not recognize them as legal entities and would not be involved in their management.  Humans have done this since prehistory without the involvement of large outside power structures, I think we could be just fine doing it that way again.
I'm a liberal, but honestly, "Bush is bad" played a large part in the democratic campaign in 2008.
Bernie Sanders isn't going to win because of defeatist attitudes like yours.  Do you believe in what he's saying? Do you believe he is worthy of your trust? Then follow him in the primaries, help get the word out. Worst thing that could happen? Clinton wins the primaries. On the long shot that Bernie wins the primaries, there  is no reason why he couldn't win the General election. Clinton is a far bigger obstacle than Jeb Bush could ever be. Bernie is not part of a political dynasty. Even if for  the sake of the elections he's running as a democrat(so as not to have a spoiler effect in the GE), he is an independent and independent voters can actually get behind him. He just needs more coverage.  If you want to get out of this shitfest, stop being part of the problem.

http://billmoyers.com/2013/09/20/by-the-numbers-the-incredibly-shrinking-american-middle-class/  Yep I'm wrong and you're right. /S  It's not scholarly but not wrong.   Edit: Wait are you saying income equality is worse than what it was in 1976? If so I'd like to see the data on that. I didn't think it was that low.
That's bullshit. They only reason his private sex life was being investigated in the first place was to try to find something to ruin him.
Yeah, it's sorta funny how when you swing so far in one direction of the political spectrum, you wind up overlapping with the opposite end.
Yeah, free ponies for everyone (but the rich fuckers, of course!) garners lots of popular support.  The real question is, could any of it pass congress? 
In most jurisdictions it is not.
But she's in favor of gun control.  All those Mom's demanding action will cream their pants over that.
  While he was golfing.
What does knocking on doors accomplish? It's pretty sad but Sanders needs the media to act like he is serious, then he will "trend" get more coverage and people will vote for him. Knocking on a door is dumber than changing minds with reddit comments.  If you want to make a difference drive people to the polls on Election Day. Register voters. Call people and remind them to vote.

Hillary will refuse to debate him. She will just take her ball ($) and go home.
Let's all just start calling a spade a spade. 'Thug' is just the new, politically correct white man's term for 'nigger'.
So who will Hillary pick for vice? 
Am I the only one who felt that Clinton would become president after her first run for president during the '09 election?  Even though Palin was just the token female running with Cheney, it was Clinton who was eventually going to be the first female in any "seat of power" in America.
[Here's](http://www.wcax.com/story/28944212/wcax-throwback-thursday) Bernie from his 1985 Burlington Mayoral campaign. He's been preaching the same message for a long time. 
Yeah, fuck it, you're right. Let's make sure to put a lying cunt in there, then.
Yeah OK... Like I'm going back to regular porn now.
Wonder when the questions about his age will come up from the left like those for McCain.  Nah....
I think you meant to say McCain instead of Cheney, although the end result would have been about the same. 
It's almost like Hillary is a relative liberal and as such agrees with Sanders 90% of the time on overarching issues, while perhaps having disagreements about the proper course of action to solve said issues.
I agree. It's about damn time we all vote third party.
Bernie Sanders is a moderate leftist. That is all. We have had moderate leftists in the past who won elections based off of sweeping rhetoric all based upon deception.  The bottom line is this: Capitalism is global, and it is relentless. The State operates as a functionary of the will of the capitalist class. Washington is entirely beholden to this class - at times they will be far-sighted and throw behind "leftist" politicians during times of dissent and unrest so they can ride out the storm.  As soon as the storm subsides, they bring back their heavy hitters (Reagan, Bush, etc).  If you think that political action stops at voting for Bernie Sanders, you are dreadfully mistaken. The Democratic Party wants you to stop at voting for their chess piece.   To quote Mao Zedong, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun". Unless Americans declare a war against capitalism and the exploitation of the working class around the world, and the Western imperialism which exploits the 3rd world's labor for its own, then progressive society will never be realized.  We must be militantly anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, and against the private ownership of the means of production. Anything less will result in an indefinite quagmire of confusion and reactionary behavior.
Reagan was practically moderate.   Just to name a few things he gave actual amnesty to 3 million illegal aliens.  Federal spending also ballooned under him.  He raised taxes 7 out of the eight years he was in office.  The only reason he is considered the right-wing national treasure is because he is one of the few Republican presidents whose semi-right-wing policies didn't completely fuck up the country.  But that's not entirely true.  Unemployment was higher under him than during the most recent recession and its effects lasted longer too.  There's also Iran Contra, the Taliban and bunch of other bullshit as well.

It's a precedent set by Washington. As in the George Washington. Everyone wanted a little bit of George, except for FDR. 
The paraphrased version is: "Bernie Sanders says he doesn't want a (marginally) better chance of winning.
I'm hoping that he strives for renewable more than coal. 
Have you ever watched a Ted Cruz speech?  You'll never see a point by point fact check of what Ted Cruz says on MSNBC.  I've never seen a candidate where the opposition coverage is so different from the points they focus on day after day.
Alright dude. 
Obama touted the Democratic Party platform.  Bernie will be the first one to tell you that he's a socialist.   Bernie is not a better choice in the general election.   I'll settle for a disappointing democrat over handing the republicans the general election any day. 
I'll probably keep saying it until the DOJ starts applying the law equally, honestly and fairly, none of which currently apply, and irrespective of the skin color of any of its members or leaders.
&gt; I'm just not going to support someone who has no chance in a general election.   Forget it man.  This sub is going to be "Bernie Can Win!!!" central for at least the next six months.   All you're going to do by attempting to shatter this perception is earn a whole lot of down votes.
The split is between left-libertarianism and right-libertarianism. Basically, libertarianism applies to a wide set of schools of thought which focus on liberty. In Europe, this includes branches such as libertarian socialism, which is an anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist form of socialism, anarcho-socialism, and a few others. In the US, the particular form of libertarian we associate with the word developed in the 20th century, and typically has laissez faire capitalism as a central tenet. This is a later development, but is almost invariably meant when the word is used in the US

I don't know if that will work in the modern era. Look at Obama, as a candidate made a lot of grandiose promises and speeches, not much came from it. Apologists will say he was *always* center-right, and you "have" to say stuff on campaign.  Look at Hillary's record. I think people would just shrug the flip-flops of Hillary as "business as usual/standard politics". You also can't compromise with obstinate crazy people who are not even willing to have a discussion outside of their biblical talking points.  I've voted 3rd party in the last two. But if the Dems are weak willed enough to give Hillary the nom(I'll caucus for Sanders if he's still in for my state), I'll highly consider just voting Republican. Just to watch stuff burn.

Even banning "assault" rifles? Most crimes are committed by other means than fire arms and even fewer by "assault" rifles. What's the point?   TLDR; Who the fuck does he think he is? 
&gt;95% of blacks do not support that stuff  sure sounds a lot to me like Ron Paul's famous newsletter blurb  &gt;"Only about 5% of blacks have sensible political opinions" 
This. What I find SO worrisome is that the votes of the uneducated/convinced in Hilary's "illusion," count equally to the more educated.   I think if Bernie seriously wants to win, he's gonna need to become much more aggressive in how he relates to Hilary by calling her out on her voting history, personal finances, acceptance of huge campaign donations, and affiliation to members of Wall Street, etc. And he can absolutely achieve it cleanly and effectively, without necessarily turning this into an ugly anti-hilary campaign. I think he is purposely trying to keep relations towards other candidates as civil as possible (which I commend him on,) but dammit, he is running for the President of the United States and first he needs to bring down Hilary!
Naysayers and reasoning like tha are the reason third parties don't win. Fuck that noise.
Better luck next time!
I'm tired of being pissed over things like this. I want to win the lottery and just fund it myself out of pocket. Fuck these idiots.
While the morality is different, both are still killers.
Yes. But the majority of politicians, including Hilary, largely believe in what they think will get them elected.   As for why that matters, consider what's been going on at the other end of the political spectrum. That's essentially the *real* effect that the "Tea Party" has had on the Republicans. Most Republicans are still the same ones they've always been, most incumbents haven't gotten overthrown. But they've shifted their voting and political stances way towards what the Tea Partiers wanted, the Republican party today is much further right/libertarian (economically) than the Republican party of 10 years ago.  The point being, if you have a bunch of Bernie Sanders's running, polling pretty well, and occasionally unseating an incumbent in some of the most far-Left districts, you're going to pull the party in that direction to adjust.
"In it to win it" seems to be exactly what he's speaking out against. Winning should always be a distant concern compared to making things better.
It's realism, he has zero chance of winning now.
We have had social media for a few years now...
I'll be the first to admit I didn't think he would run as a Dem, but I have to say I'm excited as hell..even if he just pushes Hillary more to the Progressive side.  These debates are going to be great, unlike the shit-show on the other side of the isle debating who's on their ipod.
Hear, hear! Leave the negativity for the Republican reactionaries and contrarians!

She pretty clearly wouldn't. If she was merely a pandering populist, she wouldn't be pro-gun control. 
So the race is lost before the starter pistol goes off?  How defeatist.
He's there to bring Clinton to the left. Not to actually win. Direct attacks is the worst thing that could happen for the chance of a Democrat win.
At the bottom of that article. -- Comments are closed. That tells the whole story.
You're lying. And I can support Bernie without having to smear his opponent. 
How can someone be both conservative and a centrist?
Yes, absolutely and completely lost.  We are not running this race to cross the finish line first, we are running it to get inside the stadium and in front of the crowd.  This campaign is supposed to be about honesty, and we lose our credibility immediately if the first thing out of everyone's mouths is an absurd lie.
&gt; The interesting guarantees of marriage - visitation rights, shared insurance, heritability of benefits - cannot be recreated with the unlimited right to contract.  But they could be made to work.  Why not simply pass laws that allow you to set your visitation rights to whom ever you want?  Or to allow anyone to share insurance with anyone else?  And so on.
I admire his conviction, but I'm curious if a billionaire would actually bankroll a socialist.
Every possible indicator says she will. She has the endorsements (including Warren), she has the money, the name recognition, I could go on. We tend to overestimate the number of people who think like us, and the fact is Hillary appeals to far, far more people, they're just not fanatical about it
What do you mean he didn't steal this rillos? Is that even in dispute?   I agree police reports can be BS and I knew that long before Scott Walker.  Not every middle class white person always believes the cops. Even some of us republicans don't always  believe the cops! LOL  I disagree 100% on Sharpton, he is nothing but a racist agitator,  FBI snitch,  ratting on black activists as well as white mobsters by the way. When he falsely accused an honest public official in the Tawana Brawley Case of a rape that he knew never happened he should have lost all credibility in the national conversation. Somehow johnnie Cochran decided to pay the civil judgment against Sharpton.  Al like the govt will tell you to the tune of over 4.5 million dollars, does not pay his bills. He should have also lost all credibility when he made racist comments against whites/Jews/Mormons and many others .   Somehow he gets a pass where a white person on the national stage  would never get one in a million years. Sometimes the unfair double standards go in the other direction.  I am curious why do you think white people are uncomfortable with him "talking about real issues" ? You think we don't know what the real issues are? We see the crime and incarceration rates. We see the unemployment rate for young black males, we don't get an education from Al, I can guarantee you that.  We see first hand he does nothing to address real issues, he just complains about them. Racist white people LOVE THE AL SHARPTONS of the world. There will never be anything gained by the black community when good old Rev Al steps into a situation. People who are truly against the black community are very happy to see Rev Al get involved,  progress and positive messages get stopped in their tracks when Al pops in.

As time marches on, the inevitable smear campaigns grow teeth.
Yes.
They say that because he does not have a chance.  If you are trying to convince people of the power of his ideas, yet the first words out of your mouth are "I believe he can win" then no one will believe a word you say.  That's how we will lose -- if we don't move the message into the public discourse.
dont worry man, they wont. lol you stand for everything they hate. people. 
rich white folks, poor white trash gets the boots too
Oh wow even more military spending. Always big surprises from the GOP. 
This comment represents everything wrong with the entire human race since the advent of communication.  I get it guys. I'm a sucker. A mark. A chump.  I also believe that people who get too drawn in to the political scene lose themselves in the maze of alliances, enemies, and third parties vying for support about a given law that you haven't had time to read. Fuck the fact that you haven't seen your spouse or children for 10-14 days now, fuck the part where the Americans who elected you expect you to read the shit you sign, honestly without that nonsense it has to be exhausting.  I've been called a natural born leader at many points in my life. I no longer seek leadership roles in anything except my work because that shit is too stressful for an (often) inadequate reward.  TL:DR I'd probably make a pretty damned good elected rep compared to 4/5 people holding seats in the US House of Reps at this very moment. I'd also probably be one of the most annoying and ultimately ineffective representatives my district has ever seen. I'm 25. If there's a reason I'd ever do well in politics, it's probably because I'd be willing to get aggressive over something that mattered to my constituents instead of letting everyone have a half-day plus three weeks off for no reason. I'd keep those old fuckwads in that stuffy senate chamber until they made a decision and I'd laugh like a madman the whole time.
I could only imagine the platform...  Lobbying for strict oversight regarding ethics in game journalism.  Severe punishment for the huge problem of false rape accusations faced by nearly all young men today.  Educating the public on the difference between casual bro racism and REAL racists.  Sagan gets a national holiday.   Everything involving 3 is Half Life 3's imminent release.  Privacy.  Absolutely no government spying on citizens or accessing private data.  Unless it brings nudes of the current reddit it girl.   
I know a child molester that got a free ride through college... Just for being a felon. What does Hillary want? Free MBA's for meth dealers?
&gt; people havent been voting much in the last 50 years. Your statement holds no validity.  This would only be an argument against my statement if gerrymandering and the Electoral College were recent inventions - they aren't.  &gt;When 90% or more of the country votes and things are the same, your argument might have some validity.  When everyone gets to fly around on unicorns, your argument might have some validity. You can't just declare that real problems should be ignored until some fanciful, extremely unlikely threshold you pulled out of thin air is met.  I want as many people as possible to vote, and part of trying to make that happen is fighting against things like the Electoral College and gerrymandering which discourage people from voting. Pretending everything is fine is not productive activity.
A few thousand people, some of whom aren't even old enough to vote, on reddit have a hard on for him. That's not being popular.
I could motivate my friends/coworkers to write to politicians, but it's illegal for me to take part in any protests, political campaigning, etc.
He might win a caucus if there's enough drinking, but that's an interesting discussion.  What I'm offended by are the people who think they have to say he's going to win with a straight face for this to have any validity.  they are going to hurt us by making us all look like delusional idiots.
No, it's "lack of pirates" you're thinking.
WTF are you talking about?  Do you look anything up before you post?  In the first quarter of 2007, exactly where we are now in relation to the 2016 election, **both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had raised $20 million dollars** to John Edwards' $12 million.  Honestly, please don't comment again unless you are at least going to try to be accurate.  
What do the 90's have to do with anything? Hillary was the First Lady, not the President of the United States. That was Bill. It was a good time economically *for some*. For a lot of people I know NAFTA was an absolute disaster that shuttered a lot of factory jobs and left them jobless and even homeless.    Not everyone has rose colored memories of the 90's. Certainly not when you spent a good chunk of it living in abject poverty.
Whether or not you believe that Bernie Sanders should be president, everything on reddit about him for the past day or so seems like astroturfing. Take everything you see with a grain of salt.
You're quoting Mao Zedong, but how did being "against the private ownership of the means of production" work out for him? He killed 30 million Chinese people with his horrible policies.   Maybe you can convince people on communism, but you'll need something compelling to counteract the record of death and destruction that communism leaves behind everywhere it goes.
If you continue with shit like that this campaign is fucking doomed.  And I don't mean winning or losing the nomination, I'm talking about the real goal of actually getting these messages to people who wouldn't otherwise hear them.  We should not talk about winning because of some misguided defeatism, we shouldn't talk about because it's an absurd lie that interferes with the credibility we have to talk about important issues.  If I walked up to you and told you I firmly believed that elves in my underwear helped me to maintain my balance on windy days, and then wanted to tell you about my solutions for drug policy, I would get absolutely nowhere.  Be *honest* and people will listen to what we have to say.
Us worker bees can only hope..
While I agree. This needs to be a peaceful election. Gather together to get our ideas heard. Let our ideas be heard with positivity. Not the downfall of others.
This whole thread made my heart warm
Why is this a valid position:    &gt; "Are you on the side of working people who would suffer as a result of this disastrous trade agreement, and seeing their jobs go to China or Mexico?” Mr. Sanders said recently. “Or are you on the side of corporate America and pharmaceuticals?”    But this is not?    &gt; "Are you on the side of working people who would suffer as a result of these disastrous immigration bills and executive action, and seeing their jobs go to Indian, Chinese, and Mexican immigrants?” Mr. Sanders said recently. “Or are you on the side of corporate America and big ag/IT?”    Sending jobs to china and mexico = bad.   Letting them come here and do the job = good?    Bernie sanders is in the pocket of Vermont dairy farmers who can't seem to find enough American workers to do the job.  Gee I wonder why?  Nobody wants to spend all day cleaning up cow shit and baling hay for minimum wage (or less)?  How about we let American workers bargain for what they feel is a fair price for their labor and let whatever that price is be reflected in the cost of milk?  And then put tariffs on imported dairy to protect those jobs?  I would be honored to pay $10 for a gallon of milk if it supported a working class American family.  And I would be honored to help working class American families buy milk if they can no longer afford it.  I would be happy to have Scandinavia's social policies if we also had their immigration policy.  I imagine that I'd be deported pretty quickly if I tried to live and work in Norway. 
&gt; $1.5-$2.0 billion  that is fucking ridiculous. that's what it takes to be president.
Bah. The KJV has some of the best poetry and prose in the English language in it.   Edit: Jesus wept. I'm embarrassed to love this website sometimes.
One of his campaign issues is publicly funded elections
[deleted]
I almost donated $10, but I backed out when I realized that I really don't know anything about this candidate besides that reddit adores him right now.  I'll probably donate later after after reading up on him some more.  I consider myself a rational person and a very objective thinker, but its scary to see how just reading about Bernie Sanders over and over again on Reddit makes me feel that he is the best candidate, even if I don't know much about him.  If an election was held tommorrow I'd probably vote for him just based on the information i've seen in passing on Reddit.  Makes it somewhat easier to believe how people can become indoctrinated by Fox News.
So he wants to lose?  Sounds like a PR stunt for some other elections then. He'll be saying "I didn't want to compromise my stance against big bucks, which is why I didn't win the presidency". I'm calling it now.
I am repeating that in specific response to people who are saying that he's about to take off like a rocket and win the nomination.  I push his issues more than you even know, but my comments here are addressing a very narrow, very destructive trend that could hurt the true objective of the campaign, which is to advance these issues, not take the nomination.  If we develop this culture where people are saying he's going to win in the same breath as advancing his ideas, then every potential gain we could have will be lost by leading with a lie.
This is so infuriating. The one guy who actually actively spoken out about this, and he's going to effectively lose on purpose to prove a point?
Not since Ross Perot and Ralph Nader have I given a presidential candidate this much money before. Even if he loses, I want his ideas spread so other candidates and our country at least discuss them.
Let's set up a fundme account for him so he doesn't have to bankrolled by the big corps. We can do it as the little man!
Whether or not you actually believe anything in the bible, it is a really fascinating piece of literature. There is a lot of really interesting stories and bits of history to be gleaned from it.
How objective can you be if you have no idea what people think outside the world of Reddit?

Call me cynical, but any PR firm could survey the thoughts of Americans and boil it down to a marketable message.
The only PAC I'm supporting currently is PAC-man.  I hope he knocks Mayweather out of the ring!!
A lot of those things sound like good things.
Which is why we have to prove him right. 
I... I think I'm in love. Let's see how his campaign goes, but, so far, with his track record alone and now this, he has my vote. And money.
On the one hand, what an honorable gesture.  On the other hand, it's a sign he's obviously not that serious, isn't it?
Sanders is the only self-identified socialist politician in US. That's both huge and sad.   We could use someone with that particular ideology / framework. We need politicians who are genuinely interested in welfare of public. That used to be their primary function, after all. 
Your time is infinitely more valuable to a campaign than a small contribution.The first time you volunteer, your time is worth about 15-20$/hr to the campaign.  The 2nd time you volunteer, your time is worth 30-40$/hr to the campaign.  By the 3rd and each time thereafter your time is worth about 50$/hr to the campaign.  This isn't just because you suddenly get more skilled at doing things, but the more you volunteer, the more you learn about the candidate, the more you're able to share with your friends and family.  Your friends and family are far more likely to change their opinion and even volunteer if they see that it is a cause that is important to you.    Its expected that a volunteer returning for the third time is likely to bring a friend.  You know your friend and are therefore able to train them easier than a regular staffer would be able to.  So now you're cutting back on training time and spreading the word through more than just stuffing the envelopes and dialing the phone would.  It killed me every time I spoke to somebody and they would say "Yup, I donated 20 bucks to the campaign this week!"  Or "How are we going to get him elected?  Oh you need me to volunteer?  Well, how bout I just vote for him instead"  Or my personal favorite "I tell all my friends every day to vote for him."  Contact the campaign.  Find a field office.  And spend an afternoon every week or so fighting for what you believe in.  I don't care if its Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul.  If its Hilary or Jeb.  It doesn't matter.  If you truly want your candidate to win, the best return on investment is your time and work.  edit:  I got requests to link the volunteer page for Bernie Sanders.  https://berniesanders.com/volunteer/  If you want me to put links for other campaigns, just provide the link and I'll update this.  I'm for people getting involved in the political process, haven't fully decided I'm for bernie yet.

They're both bad is true, at least in the US.  Maybe some players on the state level are still genuine, but anyone on the national scene swam through a river of blood to get there.
Well good luck with losing.
So you think cash is a more determining factor than polls? I'm being genuinely curious. I'm new to politics 
So he doesnt want to win. Good to know
This guy went to Harvard?
Really? I think almost all Greek mythology is much more interesting, and filled with far more tid bits of real history.  Almost all of the fables in the bible are rip offs of previous cultures.  Thomas Jefferson's revision (The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth) was far more interesting then the actual bible.  If only because It took the parts that are actually good and relevant and cut out all the hokus pokus.
Aah, now I get it. :-) You're trolling me.  Heh, you had me going there. Have an upvote.
In related news, Hillary Clinton celebrates that she is running unopposed...
Modern suitcase nukes are not used defensively, but [Davy Crockett](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/DavyCrockettBomb.jpg) nukes, which are *nearly* man-portable, were designed to defend against invading Soviet tank battalions.
I'm not American but I'm also not completely unfamiliar with American politics. Bernie Sanders is one of the few rational, truly liberal voices in American politics. I'm so excited by the thought that this guy could actually be president. It'd be great to see a woman president someday soon.....but Hillary is not what America needs right now. Sanders 2016!
It certainly stems from the Christian tradition, but by the time of the transcendentalist movement, influential unitarians (e.g  Emerson, Thoreau, Ripley) rejected the divinity of Christ and the idea of a personal god. They became increasingly interested with Eastern spirituality, specifically the *Bhagavad Gita*. Most importantly, during the transcendentalist movement, unitarians  developed a consensus that spirituality does not exist to govern the relationship between an individual and God, but instead serves to reinforce interpersonal relationships. Calling them Christians would be a bit out of place.
I have a hard time believing the amount of support for this guy that's just spontaneously appeared overnight around here. I mean, the dude looks pretty cool and all, but it's a little crazy how the top comments of every single thread about him are practically frothing at the mouth about the guy. He's not somebody who was talked about a lot until just a few days ago, and now he's everywhere. It stinks of planted comments and interns being paid to reddit. 
On the surface this seems like a great idea.  It's kinda wrong that the gov gets to be a third-party in every legal marriage.
So he doesn't want to win. Ok.
Read somewhere that he votes with the Democrats 98% of the time, which is why Bernie Sanders is so accepted by the party and its base.
You should totally get suspicious if any billionaire wants to fund him, you don't get to be a billionaire by funding those who want to take away your privilege and benefits. 
When Bernie gets on a roll, I always hear Larry David's George Steinbrenner yelling at people.

Reddit could potentially do it, if we were all committed to it. It would rewrite national (potentially world) history, yes. Difficult, yes. Impossible? No.
People outside reddit think? Link? I want to read more about it. 
Not if the internet has any say.
Heck, maybe we should get a few decent programmers to write a solid video game app as a fundraising tool.  I'm a pretty decent writer, so I can try to help in some way along those lines.  i'm not against doing everything we can.  I'm just cynical.
Very unironically. The "Right" seeks to anchor our future to the outdated ideologies of postwar (WWII) America and their only solution is to incite new wars and exploit humanity's desire to murder itself based on archaic belief systems (and profit from it!).   Don't allow internal conflicts to fracture the base. Stand together and generate dialogue and civil debate between like minded individuals who perhaps disagree on certain issues.   Let the "right" wallow in their own bullshit.
Sanders. Hillary is pandering.
Actually there is a lot of unique history and mythology that we can learn from the Bible.  One aspect that I find really interesting is Documentary Hypothesis.  We have learned from writing styles and the names/nouns used that many parts of the bible were written by different people during different time periods and these stories were just combined into one book.  Someone discovered that certain passages use "Elohim" and some use "Yahweh" as the name for God and deduced (combined with other information) that they must have been written by different people.  Really fun to read the bible and analyze it from this perspective.  You can see how historical events may have influence the tones of the stories written.  This also explains why certain passages are repeated in the bible with minor differences, like how the creation story is basically told twice in a row.  This also spawmed what are basically bible fan theories.  Because the Adam and Eve story is told twice, some people figured "Hey maybe it happened twice but it didn't work out." and they created the idea that before Adam and Eve, God created Adam and Lilith at the same time.  Lilith didn't want to be subservient to Adam so she basically said "Fuck you all!" and ran off to be a demon (Feminists like Lilith).  God and Adam were like, "Well shit." and God created Eve to be with him instead.  Lilith got jealous and started going around causing nocturnal emissions to steal sperm to make demon babies.  One story I really love is how the covenant of God is passed through the line of Abraham (The "chosen people" in Judaism and Islam are thought to be those who inherited this covenant).  Abraham and his wife Sarah initially had trouble conceiving so Sarah gave her handmaiden Hagar to Abraham and they had a son named Ishmael.  Eventually Sarah and Abraham are able to have a son named Isaac so Sarah makes Arbaham send Hagar and Ismael away.  Jewish people believe that God told Abraham that his and Sarah's son would inherit the covenant so they follow the lineage of Isaac.  The Muslim faith believes that Ishmael is the true heir to the covenant and he is the ancestor of Muhammad.  I don't know why, but the idea of the two sides of this story really appeals to me.  Also there's a bunch of ridiculous stories, like when David (from david and goliath) bangs another dudes wife so he sends him to the front lines of the army to go die so people won't find out he comitted adultery.  tldr; The Bible is really fun to read.
Could anyone tell me what the initials PAC stand for exactly?
Wow that's like a fraction of Los Angeles for a year!
They have office and management jobs. Of course they're not destitute. But there's a really, really, really big gap between 'destitute' and 'has a personal airfield'.
You know I remember another politician who promised to end all the wars...drugs, war wars, dirty wars, dirty wars prisons, war on insurance, war on immigration, drone war and so on. He even promises to get tough on bankers.  He promises to change America but he ended up doing almost the complete opposite.   He completely lied. He has personally directly authorised the killing of thousands. He has promised to decriminalise drugs but instead directed his agencies to attack people.  He promised to build oversight and transparency but instead has made every a secret and destroyed individual who dared to expose this.  If Sanders needs to become president he needs to attack Obama and explain how he won't become the worse president ever.
Not sure if that's legal here. 
So Bernie Sanders says he doesn't want to win? Got it. I respect the man for his values, but it's just the unfortunate reality. It's a post-Citizens United world. 
I love that one of the biggest reasons for people supporting Sanders over Clinton is her iffy-ness on campaign finance yet here are all these foreign nationals pledging to violate U.S. federal law to support his campaign. I know you all mean well but the irony of the situation is too much to resist!
It's funny... It's kind of funny..  I like Sanders. He's my senator and I could do worse..  but what does it mean to "get money out of politics?"   So many people say it, but what does it mean? What are the specifics? How do you implement this? If you forbid(or limit) private campaign contributions, what agency is now in control of campaign ads? Who is control of who gets Network airtime and who doesn't? What are *their* rules? Who appoints the leaders of the Election Commission?
Serious question: is there any reason to do this if you vote in a state with open or blanket primaries?
If Bernie Sanders doesn't want the money, then he doesn't want the job. Seriously, his campaign just failed. No money = no win.
I agree.  I donated as well.  Putting my money where my mouth is!
You see I really don't think it does....I mean if you are doing something you really believe in and support why would it suck? I mean I get people rejected the hell out of you but if you are doing something that you believe in your heart to be right then support on with no worries!!
Missouri   I just checked, and I don't have to register for a party. I'm already registered to vote, so I can just go vote at the primary. 
He just wants billionaires to bankroll his economic plan.
The fact that Lehman brothers is still top ten is ridiculous.
Fuck yes.  (I meant this as enthusiasm for the cause, editing because I realize this might have come off as dissent, it wasn't)
Of course, there are *no other possibilities* than the two you listed.  http://articles.philly.com/2001-06-03/news/25322977_1_wagon-police-officer-police-van  Leprechauns it is.
I find that people who use youtube links to support their arguments are usually idiots.  
None of these are really policy-killing problems, though, are they? Yes, there are logistics to work out, but it's not as if it's an unrealistic idea to implement a legislative change limiting total campaign contributions from private donors. 
Redditors are so easy to sway.

It's already hilarious that Bernie is everything the far left hate the most. Old, white and male.  
And destroying people's property who had nothing to do with it is also immoral.    Should he have been killed in police custody for being a bad person?  No.  Should people's homes and business be looted and destroyed because the police acted badly? No.  I fail to see how you prove that black people are not the violent thieves that the police see them as,   by being violent criminals.    If I was a black person in baltimore I'd hang my head in shame that i was being lumped in with these assholes who just want to steal and destroy.

They're more like the [Copperhead Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperhead_%28politics%29): pro-Confederate conservatives who actively work to undermine the Union.
Finally a comment that isn't circlejerking this guy. He sounds like a great candidate but he's not exactly making his chances look good.
Anyone who is aware of this fact is surely also aware that the Southern Dixicrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act later left the Democratic party and became Republicans.    The fact that this has to be explained every single time the CRA is mentioned is just proof that either conservatives are willfully stupid  or deliberately trolling.
It's not an illusion. Hillary is liberal on social issues, and is not the same as a GOP nut in any sense of the word. As someone else put it:  &gt;She's different on gay rights, drug policy, incarceration, abortion, women's rights, religion, health care policy, privatization of Social Security, school vouchers, gun rights, taxation of the wealthy, expansion of the military, prioritization of renewable energy, and marijuana legalization. The anti-Hillary hyperbole in this thread is unreal, and that's coming from a Bernie supporter.  I'm voting for Sanders too, but will be giving all of my support to Hillary if he doesn't win. The anti-Hillary rhetoric is being heavily promoted by the right because they know she's capable of defeating them.
So a little direct lying is ok?   I  not sure of the point you're making. 
A vote for 3rd party in a national election. is a vote for the GOP. You're eating right out of their hands and are going to give them another 2014. Voting 3rd party is for the local elections.  Change start from the bottom up not top down.
It's because campaign finance reform is a fundamental part of his campaign. It's how he separates himself from Clinton and paints her as beholden to big money. He says this so that no one starts one for him and undercuts his message by making him a hypocrite.
Fuck me, what an echo-chamber this sub is. I'm not even American and these responses make me extremely suspicious.
How old are you if you don't mind me asking?  
May I suggest that we attempt to gain a stronghold in the /r/murica subreddit? I am a subscriber, and a proud patriot, and I feel like a good following in this sub would mean for a really good turnout for them. The word "socialist" is going to hurt Bernie a lot in this campaign, but if we can get people like these guys to just READ a little...we might have something here.
She is not different from the GOP on some of those and there are some republican candidates that have better stances than she does on those issues.
If this guy doesn't win America is more fucked than I thought 
No billionaires? Shit. 
Isn't that pretty much what Obama set up the perception of doing, and it totalled like 15% of contributions? He just lost with this announcement. No need to waste our money. 
I'm going to do my fair share regardless. I'm just dissapointed because Bernie needs to help himself as well. Facing off against Hillary is an uphill battle even with a level financial playing field. 
So is /r/sandersforpresident and /r/politics.
Please never say that again
Cops are so dumb, crooked and violent that I don't trust ONE single report.  Cops exacerbate/worsen every situation, including filing reports.
Shit, I don't even hold out hopes that we'll get seatbelts in those vans.  More likely we'll just get a bunch of right-wingers continuing to post discredited lies in order to blame the black man for breaking his own neck.
Well it's better than paid shills/mindless nationalists who usually determine the political agenda of Reddit.
So do nothing? You can make one extreme example so it all must be bull?

Overhyped and shitty?
Annd volunteering is fun! Though I'm never doing door to door again, would be willing to volunteer for Bernie.
To be fair... it's not like this money up and disappears. What do you think her campaign spends the money on? Advertisers, advisors, etc. This money doesn't just *disappear.* Sure, it's not as noble as feeding the homeless. But people with jobs are getting this money, so it isn't as evil as people make it seem.
Man, I'm not even republican. What is wrong with you? Haha, you are getting so angry over this.  Is it past your bed time, little guy?
Yes. This. This train is on the fast track to loserville.  I'm not naive and I'm a realist. This dude will be watching election night next November just like the rest of us - at home, not at a campaign headquarters.  The circle jerking is out of hand here. 
Do you want my vote, because thats how you get my vote
You say that like people on the internet have never changed their opinion, or for that matter, voted in a presidential election.

Yeah...... He had close to zero chance before this and without money (and thus without broad operations in almost every state, relentless targeted local and broad national ad buys, and what are likely very expensive turf mapping and targeting systems used by OFA) his odds are even worse.    Our best hope now is that he puts on an impressive debate performance or two that helps shift the platform of serious contenders - which, I might add is a very very valuable function of candidates like Mr. Sanders.
I'm normally a single issue gun rights voter, but I'm seriously considering pushing for Sanders.
Like that's going to pass through the senate. If you want to kill trees for useless bills, buy an ax.
Thank you. I'm "far left" by most peoples conventions, but why would I hate someone simply because of their gender/age/skin color? Discrimination is not something the left should be or is associated with. 
Eh, most people know he probly won't win, but thats not the only possible positive outcome. It's still a good thing that he's running.

There is barley a chance if he does - no chance if he doesn't.    I really like him... But I liked the Biden and Kucinich platforms in 2008 and neither one of them had s snowballs chance in hell.

We hire people to represent us, we do not hire people that can't keep up or require lobbying to change their positions. If the representative is incapable of sticking to the issues, requires lobbyists to direct their vote, or can't keep up with current trends, then they have no business pretending to represent whom they clearly know nothing about. This means that they will have to work for a living, much like everyone else. None of these BS fundraising events, none of these parties, none of these backroom deals. It ends. They have to pay attention. It's not the citizen's job to go out of our way to inform politicians when we pay them so much and they keep up so poorly.
Or maybe because flipping burgers isn't worth $15/hr?
If it says he said he wouldn't launch a SuperPAC but he never said he wouldn't launch a SuperPAC then that's just poor journalism.

Why in the world does any responsible human think we need to encourage more gun sales? I'm all in favor of allowing gun sales, but actively trying to get people to buy more?   I fought to ensure Americans had the right to buy guns, but that doesn't mean I think most are responsible enough that I'd want them to own one.
Say that again as the teapublicans slash the education budget by 50%. So they can increase defense spending another 400 billion a year. Which they will need when they start the offensive war against Iran. 
You're just continuing the insult-train. It can be quite self-justifying, can't it? 
&gt; 50 years ago people that came to this country would assimilate and become Americans  Quite the overgeneralization. You realize there used to be a large german speaking population here right?
Here come the Hillary apologists / attack dogs already. That was fast.
Lehman Brothers doing pretty well donating $360k considering they're bankrupt. 
The difference here is Obama mentioned the lack of fathers as an example of the lack of opportunity these people grow up in, unlike Paul who blamed the violence on the lack of a father. Basically, Paul said the neighborhood crashed because the driver was speeding, while Obama said we shouldn't be surprised if a driver crashes when the accelerator gets stuck, the brakes fail, and steering goes out.
The government was just as able to collect taxes before police militarization.  Stop trying to turn everything into a partisan shit-fight.
Don't worry about that, you aren't going to have that many people support your campaign anyway.
Personally I don't think we should distribute wealth to everyone. You want incentives to innovate and work hard as well as take risks. If I am contributing 5x more in terms of wealth to the economy I should get more out of it. Governments aren't good at being as efficient as possible in many spaces (although they are good at some!)  That said I am actually pro-tax and pro-redistribution. I think the idea of 'rich schools' and 'poor schools' is absurd. We should have a basic standard of living. We should focus more on ensuring equality of opportunity because that doesn't just happen. We need to spend money to try to help the poor kid do better.  But the idea that a software developer or brilliant engineer should make the same as a clerk is ridiculous. 
I want to see who votes it down. 
That only applies to thugs though.
You ask about responsible humans but it clearly says Texas in the headline
A President can create jobs, but only if he's a Democrat, right?  I mean you guys make him out to be Flash Gordon...ahhh...he'll save every one of us!  I mean, this stuff kills me with the level of fan boy going on, it's borderline lunacy. 
the united states has laws, enforced by the government, with a democratic system for nonviolent reform. rioting is not a valid act, particularly when the channels of nonviolent reform haven't even been utilized.   if an assembled crowd arbitrarily overflows into the street and blocks ordinary street traffic, and the people in the street refuse and resist to allow ordinary traffic to pass through, arrests seem pretty valid.
Reagan had alzheimers.

They need to pass mandatory concealed carry and be done with it.  Until every stroller has a glock under the baby, no one will be safe.
&gt; which he feels will resonate...  ..but will have a far lesser impact than he's predicting.
The Republican way: spend taxpayers money on things that don't benefit the citizens. Like the overpriced military equipment to attack innocent countries.
Well that's why. The NRA doesn't want reasonable gun rights. They want full on 2nd amendment freedom to make as much profit as possible. 
Let's all take a moment and remember SCOTUS, who in their infinite wisdom, lifted financial restrictions on political candidates and introduced massive corruption and corporate control over the election processes.  Fucking bastards - they should be tried for treason.
Yes, but that goes both ways.  There are gays that would not be happy with fully functional civil unions recognized by all levels of the state. The won't be happy until the government calls it "marriage".  
Obama is right about the dishonesty behind the repeated "it's secret" attacks on TPP.  There's nothing about the TPP that's more secretive than any other international agreement.  But it's hard to argue about the effectiveness of that "secrecy" attack--you see commenters here and writers elsewhere repeating that line over and over.  Here's what Obama said:  &gt; Obama seemed to implicitly reference Warren's response on the call on Friday, noting that members of Congress can now view the text of the pact and will have months to review the agreement before voting on the final version. &gt;  &gt; "Every single one of the critics saying this is a secret deal, or send out e-mails to their fundraising base that they're working to stop a secret deal, could walk over and see the text of the agreement," Obama said. "When I just keep on hearing people repeating this notion that it's secret -- I gotta say, it's dishonest. And it's a little concerning when I see friends of mine resorting to those sort of tactics."  The drafts of the agreement are kept secret from the public--just like they are for every international agreement, and for good reason.  The agree-upon sections are available to Congresspeople.  And once the agreement is finalized, the full text will be available to everyone before the Senate votes to either approve it or reject it. 
&gt; Why the hell did the van drive around for twenty minutes, away from the police department, and then why when they asked for assistance with Freddie's injuries did they instead go pick up a second guy?  Because they didn't care and knew they'd get away with it.
If you take corporate money out of politics then you have to take union money out of politics too.  
Because lots of people hate having randos knocking on their door or call them. For any reason. I'd be what I hate if I was a canvassing person.
Now you're just trolling. It's well known that 90 to 95% of blacks vote Democrat, and that the Democrats are in favor of late term abortion and put it in their party's platform. 
Isn't she older than Obama's daughter.  So isn't she next in line for the throne, sorry I meant office, after the next Bush ?
&gt;Basically, I don't foresee any scenario where Kansas tells us about anything.  Yeah, Kansas is just one of the many Republican-dominated states and Kansas doesn't portend the policies of a Republican presidency. Like it or not, we should probably get used to the idea, because right now, I think it's more likely than not that the Democrats will throw the 2016 election, no matter who's their nominee.
Well, all he has done so far is make promises, which every politician is great at doing. We will find out about his honesty as times goes on.
I find that people that have usernames inspired by Star Trek are usually virgins.
Proposing policy does nothing if you can't get it passed. *If* Sanders can get the nomination, and *if* he can win the presidency, then he has to deal with Congress. After the last 7 years, I think we know how that goes.
What battle was that, exactly? 
Absolutely. I know a few women who are planning to vote for her no matter what.
One reason Hillary is a better candidate than Sanders: electability.  Sorry guys, Sanders will never win a general election.  If I remotely thought he could he would be my candidate.
Oh!  That's how you spell it.  Thank you!

and look at the current state of modern countries' economies....just peachy, right?
&gt;You're tying "real politicians" to "accepting money from billionaires." Lovely.  Not only billionaires donate to PACs. I have donated to a PAC of my choice in the past. My money gets lumped in with those who do better than I do, but that doesn't mean that the money is some how "tainted" or less important.  &gt;I haven't made a valid point?  Nope.  &gt;Sanders won VT as an independent vs an incredibly wealthy candidate, on the financing of individual donations.  The political landscape of a state with 600,000 people vs. trying to win a Democratic presidential candidacy in 50 states is a hugely different scenario. If you can't see this, then God help you. It's one man and a bunch of microdonations vs. people with the resources to actually make that happen.  &gt;What do you think he could do with the backing of the Democratic party?  What exactly do you mean when you say "the backing of the Democratic party?" Party backing means financial backing - and some of that money comes from the "billionaires" you speak of, which then leaves your candidate with two options:  * Lose the election because you're not going to accept money from the DNC  and it's PACs  * Take the money, have a legitimate chance at the presidency, but become a hypocrite in the process. 
The numbers aren't quite that bad, though there is a correlation between more people voting and the center of that vote swinging towards progressivism.  But the other secret that holds the GOP in power is carefully picking social wedge issues, and using points like abortion and gay marriage and immigration to distract voters from the fact that their tax break platform essentially works against 98% of the population, and their trickle down economics theory is utter bullshit.

No the Sec of State is looking into whether BERNIE can run in NH as a Democrat or does he have to run as a third party candidate.  Nobody is saying he cannot speak. 
Speaking of mental gymnasitics.....
Well. I am a classic liberal (i hate pretty much every party that exists right now because they all loathe freedom in one way or another) and the only major thing i noticed right off the bat is that Sanders is somewhat anti gun. Which is not okay with me. It appears to be limited to "assault rifles" but still. You cant trust someone who lets fear control their political viewpoints. Let alone that to be someone who wants to ban semiautomatic rifles with cosmetic features requires some significant mental gymnastics to justify. We banned them once, the DOJ concluded it made no impact on crime. They make up a very small fraction of gun crime, but because they look scary (apparently) that means they must be evil and banned.  But who knows, maybe this man will actually read about the mountains of research on gun control and how it has anywhere from no impact on crime to actually increasing crime and realise that the left makes up garbage just as much as the right.
This is why I think people are stupid if they decide not to vote Clinton if she becomes the Dem nominee. You will be supporting this vision of America through your refusal to participate.  I just hope to god national voters are so far gone and self-harming as Kansas voters.
&gt;I for one want the infamous gun show loophole closed  There is no such thing.  &gt;and see no need for aks  Why? Because they look scary? And since when were rights based on needs? Do you "need" to exercise your free speech here on Reddit and have it reach a large number of people?  &gt;do we sue glad baggies because some marijuana dealers like to use them?  I like that one, it's genius. I'm going to use that. Thanks.
A waiting period may result in slightly fewer guns sold. They have devolved into a mouthpiece for gun manufacturers, and profit margin is all that matters to them.
Fuck money. Get Votes
I'm not joking, I'm moving to another country if Republicans win in 2016. It'll show me that a majority of Americans are too dumb to know what's good for them. My ancestors moved to the US for a better life, not a shittier one.
&gt;Yes  Thought so
No, they create jobs that are worth $100,000 but pay $60,000 dollars a year and you need to pay $100,000 to get the job
That's just silly.  I don't even support Sanders for president - and I don't believe this is some kind of "planted comments".  If you think that, you don't know Reddit very well.
I dont post that for the partisan liberals. I post it for the more open minded.
Al Sharpton is not the spokesperson for all black people, though. Regardless of his tax evasion, he is irrelevant. The only people who talk about Al Sharpton are people who need an individual to direct their racist vitriol at so it doesn't seem like they're racist against all black people.  The only people you're fooling are yourself, and Almost Politically Correct Redneck.
You think I won't?  I'm almost done with college. I have no family. There is no reason for me to stay. The US will become the world's biggest brain drain.

Feel free to demonstrate that the number of blacks and hispanics who support both late term abortion and gay marriage are roughly equal  to the number who vote Democrat, then. No reasonably informed person actually thinks that their views on social issues reflect their voting patterns. Social issues are, of course, one of the ways the GOP could chip away from the Democrats' margins with non-white voters. 
Because the nation is different then a state. (in the same way that a nation is not a city)   You can find shit states in under D and R control, and there are successful states under D and R control. 
The problem isnt always hourly wage, but hours worked.  7.25 with 40hours should be 300 per week after taxes.  100 per week is what my family spends on groceries.  That leaves about 800/month for shelter.  Very doable.  Now, when you only work 20 hours a week, it is not feasible.  1200 per month with a cheap 1 bedroom apt or trailer, couponing while shopping, and staying to the outter perimeter of the store, bicycle or public trans to flip burgers, thrift store/yard sale clothes.  It sucks, but it is livable.  If it isnt, get 2 jobs.  If I want more cool shit, I take as much overtime as possible.  Once again the issue is rmployees NOT getting 40 hours.  20 hours at $15/hr isnt much better than 20 hours at minimum wage you know.
Our political system is based on compromise.

He's not a Wall Street whore.   Do you guys really need more than one?
And that last is exactly my point. One doesn't represent the people that voted for one. In actual fact, one represents every citizen in ones jurisdiction or other area of political management. Whether you agree with them or not, whether they liked you or not, you ARE *their* representative, when getting voted into any political (not judicial) office.
Obama accusing others of... *lying*???  Wow. Now that's chutzpah.
Best of luck to him.  Really, I mean that.  It's going to be a long road against the big monied interests.
I'm just saying, you might want to calm down.  People claim this every election on both sides, and you know what?  Things end up okay.  It turns out, even when we have not the best candidate in the white house, we still have groups of hardworking people trying to find the right solutions.
He is like a puffer fish or one of those frilled lizards.  He has to make himself appear big or else he'd be eaten.
The Republican candidates have already said what they intend to do if elected. Fuck that.   And guess what? Every election, people DO move, Republican or Democrat. Hell, I'll probably move if Hillary wins.
That's my point. It is used to divide us from each other to make us (the plebs, or proles) easier for conquering by the upper class.
to be fair, everyone is into reducing debt, social security is unsustainable over time because of stagnant population growth, the US tax rates are the highest in the world, and our public schools are some of the worst in the world (including the highest funded ones).  its not inconceivable that government spending needs to be reigned in with better priorities and results, that the national teachers union has basically gutted the quality out of our public school system, that increasing taxes will reduce tax revenue by driving smart money out into less hostile foreign tax environments, and that transforming social security into something more like a sovereign wealth fund might be necessary make the social security program sustainable despite flat or declining population trends.  regarding medicare and other medical expenses - the government should cap all medical companies profit margin, to reduce patient costs and make it affordable for the country to implement a state program similar to the UK or Canada. They're probably hesitant to do that though because most of the medical innovation in the last 70years resulted from high profit margins in the medical industry attracting lots of investment, which enabled companies to produce and develop most of what's used in practice today. presumably, limiting the medical industry's profits would induce investors to divest medical companies' operating capital, and with fewer resources there'd be a slower rate of development for new drugs, devices, procedures, and equipment.  so - whether or not you're wealthy, a lot of the changes you seem opposed to could in fact be very rational.
He never said it was a 4 year degree, lots of people do 2 years at a community college and call it good. Who cares that it's in the ghetto? It's unrealistic to say that everyone should make enough to not live there, everyone should make more money but someone has to live in that part of town. He also never said if he had roommates or anything, my first place out off my patents house was me, my best friend, and his girlfriend so my share of the bills was only $200 a month which is definitely doable on minimum wage.
I have mixed feelings about this.  I appreciate what they are doing but this just adds fuel to the religious right's anti-abortion ferver.  Women are already dying from pregnancies with regularity in the southern states, increased attacks from the pro-"life" side will just cause more suffering.
Optimism is great; however, saying that him being elected will change American politics forever is hyperbolic. This is coming from a huge Bernie supporter. 
Now comes the smear campaign against her and the Grand Jury refusing to indict.  Then shit is going to get really out of control in Baltimore.  :(
Your inability to read the actual quotes and understand them doesn't mean those who can are engaging in mental gymnastics.
I'm saddened that you think people should have their rights removed without actually committing a crime.  Does due process or prior restraint not exist in your fantasy world?
Donated. Hopefully the next news story is about the insane amount of money he raised.
I would also like to see a list of the top school districs admin salaries

This isn't any different than offering tax incentives for any other business.  And it only takes place for one weekend a year - This is meant to spur local purchasing and encourage hunters &amp; sportsmen to choose Texas for their activities.  Though it may cost $3.6 million initially for firearms specific sales, those who take advantage are going to be spending money in other areas that will more than make up for the loss.
Stereotypes on /r/politics are ok as long as they make fun of white people.

Democrats have yet to understand that prosperity does not come from thin air.  It is created by business.  This wage hike, as many of us already know, will crush 100's of small businesses and increase unemployment.  
Where exactly did I suggest removing people's rights?
If you cannot see the difference between lying hyperbole claiming someone is a socialist, and an actual proud socialist, then I do not know what else to say
"Bernie Sanders saying he will not be elected president!"
When one business closes, another opens - happens everyday.
Here's the election where Hitler came to power.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_presidential_election,_1932  He didn't come to power through democratic means, it was through violence and intimidation.
I don't think you know what an acronym is. It's when a group of words can be shortened to their first letter and then you pronounce the new group of letters like a word. An exa1mple of this would be P.E.T.A. If the group of letters is something that is read then it is an initial ism. An example of that would be the C.I.A. I hope this helps you out in the future. 
TL/DR: White folks just don't get it.
So, on things you have no moral or factual leg to stand on. Got it.
I am curious as to how you would justify treason charges.
And Bernie's is not?  $15 minimum wage? Even the most ardent academic supporters of the minimum wage would not say that high. And even then, they'd probably agree the better alternative is to reform the EITC.  Anti free-trade? Free trade is probably the issue with the *widest* consensus in economics, and Senator Sanders has taken the position completely the opposite of it.  I think Senator Sanders has some worthwhile ideals. His economic policy however, is not one of those things. It's misguided and lacking in empirical/theoretical backing.
Here's what you do: Look up the cosponsors of the bill, and anyone that voted in favor of it, and see where they received their campaign donations from. I'd be willing to bet there's a particular group of manufacturers that would have thought it prudent to invest a bit of money into purchasing votes from legislators that would drum up demand and therefore sales of their own products. The industry is using the government to create incentives to sell more products to the tune of $3.6 million per year of public money that could go to education or infrastructure.  On the gun control side of the coin, it's a bit like when California Senator Leland Yee was pushing firearm regulation at the same time he was running guns on the black market. Prohibited or regulated products tend to command higher prices, and he knew that. Not unlike off the grid cannabis distributors that voted against cannabis legalization.   Either way, business is business as it were. Follow the money.

citizens united didn't help things. 
Let's be honest, neither side wants this.  The left would have to disclose the SEIU, Tom Styer, and George Soros. They're equally unpopular with the right as the Koch brothers are with the left. Just having money doesn't mean you lose your right to free speech. Unless you wish to be Jacobin, you have to let them speak as freely as the people here who hide behind usernames.  It's easy to call for other people to be held accountable for what they say when you don't have to be 
"Economics" isn't something you can point out to explain something, it is not religion.  
Well, personally, my rationale is that I think anonymity is an important component of free speech. Simply because you engage in a certain type/amount of free speech does not give up the right to do it anonymously. Furthermore, if we want to view this a different way, it's a logical fallacy to use a source to determine if you agree or disagree with something. If the Kochs are as evil as some people here say, the "Evil" messages themselves should be sufficient.  It's kindof jumping the gun to already be labeling something you haven't yet heard as "bullshit spin"...Be open to having your mind changed.

&gt;If you say that you don't feel people are responsible enough to exercise their rights, you are saying they shouldn't have them.   No, I'm just saying I personally feel most people are not responsible enough to be gun owners. It's like how I fully support your right to call a muscle bound biker all sorts of names, but think you shouldn't... I'm pretty sure the outcome is going to be really bad, but support your right to make your own poor decisions.
1.  Its not like welfare is cushy to begin with, if there were better jobs, people would be taking them.  Its not like people want to be on welfare.    2.  Where are people going to get the money to get better educated?  Its not like getting an education is cheap.  Also work training program funding is so limited that it can't come close to keeping up with the demand. 
This was very well said, and I agree with every single letter you typed. Mind if I copy/paste this sometime in the future? 
Implementing such a policy would eliminate pandering to the staple of the Republican base.  Political suicide.  Rabble rousing of religious fundamentalists, anti-science people, paranoid "patriots," birthers, please proceed.

Many young people don't see much difference between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to issues they care about. Both parties are generally controlled by large banks and corporations.   Edit: I should note that I'm not advocating this position, just what I have seen and heard. 
Then there isn't enough, say it with me, **demand** to meet the **supply**.  
Well don't raise the cutoff to 2m. I have no background to be talking about this subject but raise it to like 200-300k. Idk.

Six reasons why he's a better candidate, and six million why he doesn't have a chance in hell...
I've never understood this argument where people ignore the issues and the merits of a candidacy and just say "don't vote for him because he can't win."  If people take that advice then yes, he can't win.  Great alternative though, instead of voting for an underdog candidate that you think would be a great president, vote for someone who you think has a better chance of winning and will be a lousy president. Then there's a better chance of your candidate winning, but who cares if you don't even like them?  Also, congrats on being cynical. We all think you're really cool and obviously smarter and more sophisticated than we could ever hope to be. From the depths of our naivety and ignorance we thank you for your brilliant contribution.
Our country will go to shit? Oh wait never mind it is shit. They will just rub it in your face when the GOP gets into office.
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
The "Left" proposed it.  They have less to hide and their backers usually do so for altruistic reasons, not personal financial gain.
Maybe it's an indicator of something, dear Sherlock
Pro 2A liberal gun owner here. I couldnt agree more. 
clearly you need to read about the race riots of the late 60's. it ruined cities like Detroit, Newark, Baltimore, and a few others. kills national demand for property which reduces equity value for residents, investment pulls out and moves to safer markets, companies relocate to secure locations, then jobs disappear, tax revenue drops off a cliff so schools get defunded or shut down, infrastructure crumbles, and the people who don't have enough money to leave get trapped there as crime explodes.  you sound like a short sighted, ignorant, self-righteous prick. whipped up into a frenzy by the media, ready to shoot yourself in the foot.  seriously. go read some history.  and FYI - no one can actually buy a vote, they just buy up airtime and ad space for people who can be as easily manipulated as yourself.  
The Laffer curve is actually not bullshit. At both 0% and 100% tax rates, government revenue is 0. As you move from either point, revenues will increase until you find the peak of the curve.   The issue is that we really have no idea what the shape of the curve is. We can tell that neither 90% nor 40% top marginal tax rates are optimal, but we haven't tested enough rates to have any real idea what the peak is. (Currently, 70% gave us the best overall return, but we've never tried anything between 70 and 40%) 
Add, "if they believed correctly, they'd be successful." 
This *repeated* claim is simply untrue if you spend some time thinking through the economics of it.  https://www.economy.com/dismal/analysis/datapoints/253947/Government-Assistance-and-Work/  "Unfortunately, there is little basis to claim that most public assistance programs benefit employers. "  Also, if someone *really* believes this to be the case, why don't we eliminate these public assistance programs? Surely if they are just going mostly to help corporations, there would be not large outcry if they were taken away, since corporations will simply pay more...right?
The news reports I saw said there was union activity in all the stores with "plumbing problems".  And cleverly enough one of the reporters had the sense to interview a plumber.  According to the plumber there isn't a plumbing problem in the world that would take more than 2 weeks and that would be one which required replacing pipes embedded in the slab.
Well, you're free to your opinion, but you opinion has no bearing on what I did while in service.

They didn't target him.  They made an illegal turn, wouldn't stop when the police tried to pull him over, and were wearing masks at the time...maybe the police over reacted in taking him in and wanting to talk to him, but he isn't getting charged with anything right now.  Unlike the 6 police officers who got the book thrown at them (Damn Good Thing).  He's not even in custody right now.  Unless this takes a wrong turn this story may end here  *Edit:  Good thing the cops had the book thrown at them, if you couldn't tell initially
Ah, thanks for that source. My site seemed slim on the number of bills he voted on. I haven't read all those bills, but in general being against high capacity assault weapons doesn't equate to supporting unreasonable gun laws.
The demand is there for comic books, as demonstrated by the fact that the shop has been open for 25 years.  The government is legislating it out of business.  Set minimum wage high enough and there isn't enough demand for anything.
It's called being skeptical, not opinionated. Are you sure you have no information on that supposed threat to the free market and the 2nd Amendment?

You may want to brush up on reading comprehension. "less to hide"
&gt;David Wildstein admitted today to conspiring with Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly to close the lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 to "punish" the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie in his re-election bid.
Since trapping animals has nothing to do with gun control? Since shooting pigeons launched out of spring loaded boxes has nothing to do with gun control? Neither of those things has anything to do with your right to keep and bear arms, yet the NRA lobbies on them.
You mean where they arrest cops for homicides (like they did today) and start taking a serious look at police reform?    You've convinced me to vote Democrat.  
TLDR: He is a self described socialist.
step in the right direction. We cannot allow the police to hide behind the badge when they commit a crime- especially homicide. And any honest, good cop would agree. 
&gt;he housing crisis was caused by Jimmy Carter with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act. Never mind that there were 12 years of Republicans in the White House afterwards.  I look at it cynically. Both sides are really in the pockets of the big banks. The CRA may have been well-meaning, but after bankers found a way to make lots of money off of it, neither side really wanted to stop the money rolling in from their rich banker friends. Some played lip service, even Bush II asked Congress to put some brakes on the most egregious abuses, but there was never going to be a concerted effort to stop this as long as the campaign money and other perks (think Countrywide and Chris Dodd) kept coming. 
&gt; In this case if they cracked down on the obvious dog-whistle-racist trolls, /r/Conservative would rant for weeks about how "/r/politics is nothing but a liberal circlejerk".  1.

&gt;Never understood the Soros hate  Look into the damage he has done with currency manipulation, insider trading, and his funding of terrorist groups.
No, I don't.  We were adding seats at colleges equal or faster than demand up until 2008-2009, and costs were still wildly increasing.  Admin costs are the number one culprit, and there is absolutely no justifiable reason for them to increase at the rate they are.  http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=2408   "“Between 1993 and 2007,” they write, “the number of full-time administrators per 100 students at America’s leading universities grew by 39 percent, while the number of employees engaged in teaching, research, or service only grew by 18 percent. Inflation-adjusted spending on administration per student grew by 61 percent during the same period, while instructional spending per student rose 39 percent.” "   That is a scam.  Inflation doesn't single out industries.        
So we should make who you vote for public? Because influencing public affairs.
Please refrain from insulting other users.  This is a warning. 
What's the point of this? There are real problems in Texas. A lack of guns isn't one of them. 
Right. Just about all of his funding will be from small donations from individuals. The difference between him and FDR though is that FDR had a national crisis to campaign with that had been horribly handled by the Republican before him. That's what drove the public so far to the left. There are some big issues today, but nothing on the scale of the depression that could really shift he public that far left again.   I don't think he will succeed in even pushing the agenda however because Hillary has already adopted most of his issues on a pretty basic level. I mean, aside from campaign finance reform how different is he really from Hillary on paper? Think about trying to summarize his positions to one sentence and then compare those to Hillary's. I know they have very different ideologies, but Hillary can adapt to all of them very easily without having to really explain herself because it's not like the American public reads in-depth analyses of their real ideological differences. 
268,820 square miles of fucking right wing lunacy. Can we please just give it back to mexico, no questions asked? 
Yeah, this is true. The establishment (leadership and big donors) will be for Hillary. So will Democrats for whom feminism is their priority -- which is totally legitimate. It's an uphill battle for a more liberal challenger, but one that needs to happen. If Bernie can demonstrate the political value of economic populism in appealing to independents, he can hand the eventual winner a tool for the general. That's what I mean by moving the party. Democrats are afraid to use that opportunity, but I think they need it to win in the general. 
&gt; Oh, this place is right most of the time  /r/politics is comedy gold
Sort of.  What it signals to me is that he has no intention of winning and just wants to raise issues, which is fine except that he's probably going to end up weakening enthusiasm and support for Clinton in the process and could make it more likely for a Republican to win.  That's not his fault, it's because we have stupid FPTP voting, but I'm still not sure I can respect it if it leads to predictable, terrible outcomes.
How is that even remotely comparable?
I've been seeing a lot of conservative types concern trolling about Hillary though.  I don't know that this is any different.
I assume they have better evidence than "he wasn't wearing a seatbelt."

Ita not congress' fault that your labor is worthless. Its globalization. And if youre in a job that would pay you *even less* if there weren't a price floor on wages, maybe its time to acquire some technical skills at one of the nations many community colleges offering associates degrees and training for a number of professions!   Robots are coming. They are going to wipe out *every* minimum wage job in the next 20 years. This is a pointless, short term debate that does not address a long term problem.

Yea those damn evil rich scumbags wanting to balance the budget and reduce the debt for the health of this country for future generations.  Bastards.  Also, the current Keynesian economic system has been doing so well for the poor over the last 100 years... Maybe if we keep going for another century we'll see things change /s
It isn't being legislated out of business by the government is what I am saying.  It is succumbing to our economic system.  What you are arguing is for a McDonald's system where they tell their employees to go get food stamps that my tax dollars pay for because they don't want to pay a decent wage.  If the Wal-Marts of the world couldn't do that then they wouldn't compete with the small business as well in the first place.    In a situation where everyone is being impacted equally, such as a minimum wage hike, there isn't this unfairness introduced and so it's not germane to the conversation.  People with more money spend their money more.  If you've ever worked in a food-service situation that has alcohol you've likely heard the phrase "giving it back to the bar".  That's when the employees take their paycheck, and turn right back around and spend it at their place of work.  If your employees don't want your own product, you have other issues with your business model than what you are paying them.  Minimum wage hikes do no directly translate to business closures.  This is demonstrable, but hopefully this little anecdotal story helps as well.    As for this comic book shop.

I can hear conservatives across the country saying that now.  All the while they have ignored this as a real problem in some communities for years and told people to quit whining about it.  Suddenly though, they seem critical of a system.  Funny how that works.
..she will?
And so it begins. From fox to hannity to rw sites across the web.....  People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .  When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"  Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.  We get it conservatives, we really do :)
It's very important to look up your state's rules. Texas, for example, doesn't make you choose when you register to vote. Instead, you choose when you show up at the primaries to vote. Once you pick one, you can't vote in the other. This makes it easy to vote for different party's primary every year if you wanted to.
And Hillary disclose foreign contributors and what she's done for them. 
Exactly. However it should be noted that this is a post about Bernie Sanders so most people reading probably already have an interest in Bernie Sanders or they would not be reading this in the first place. 
This doesn't even make sense. Schools are not run by the Federal government. Is she saying a Republican would first nationalize schools then defund them?

&gt; the Obama administration, in conjunction with the U.S. military and Wal-Mart, is planning to impose martial law on much of the country.   Wal-Mart??   Obama &amp;  fucking Wal-Mart??  I guess Wal-Mart lures you in the front door with **LOW LOW** prices, takes your gun away, and forces you out the back door and into one of the many shipping containers and truck you off to the FEMA camps where you will be fed to the reptilian aliens.  amirite??
Bernie Sanders is the reason the Obama administration has pushed for tougher environmental regulations and deals with countries like China? Come on now, I cannot view this sub it might as well just be a big picture of Bernie with a halo around his head for the next few weeks or as long as his PR team paid for this endless spamming of pro Sanders articles
 Yes there were some Dems who drank the koolaid. however there were zero Repubs against it. Zero. there were Dems who fought Graham for years over his constant push to end financial regulation.  When it was passed, Durbin came out and said it was a disaster. Byrd and Sanders did too. Show me one Repub who was against it.The Dems stopped him for a decade .

Yep
I thought all liberal talking points were already copied and pasted.
That's only 8 years from 2008.  In 2008 Barack "Let's kill even MORE Afghan women and children!" Obomber soundly defeated Dennis Kucinich in an election where only liberals &amp; Democrats were voting.  Even though Kucinich is not even 1/10th as anti-war or anti-violence as M. Theresa.  I think you seriously underestimate how much of a pack of bloodthirsty warmongery fuhrer-worshipping savages your fellow Americans - even Democrats - are.

Why is the victims race stated but not the cops??
It's funny how scandals involving Hillary, or any Democrat for that matter, are mocked and ridiculed around here but here we are discussing "bridgegate" months later. 
And yet we have all of those things.  Surely this means we live under the evil rich's iron fist, and not by the stupid whims of what the masses want in the moment regardless of future consequences.  Also who the fuck isn't for debt reduction? Is there someone here that is for debt creation? It's like no one can think for even a moment any more. Guess that's why you want a government to run every aspect of your lives and provide endlessly for you.
Isn't it obvious?  Once Obama and the Miltary are in cahoots, Walmart is quick to follow.  All the signs are there.  First off WAL?  As in Welcome Alien Latinos. MART? Marginalize American Right-thinking Teapartiers.  This shit goes deep.
The Bible.  Seriously.
&gt;Also who the fuck isn't for debt reduction? Is there someone here that is for debt creation?  The Huffington Post and most of their readers
&gt; prosperity does not come from thin air. It is created by business.  Demand creates jobs, not fuckwads in the GOP or Wall Street hucksters lobbying for lower taxes as a reward for not innovating, not producing and not performing a service.
  Christie was in charge and appointed all the people involved. He set the tenor and attitude in the office. Of course he has zero responsibility. He was hands on until he wasn't. Which is every time something went wrong.
&gt;First, Sanders is liberal, and can sincerely sell a liberal vision to Democratic primary voters. Unlike Martin O’Malley, whose past public statements qualify as “moderate” according to OnTheIssues.org, Sanders is a “hardcore liberal.” On a standardized scale of -100 to 100 (with -100 being the most conservative and 100 being the most liberal), **Sanders hits 54**; O’Malley’s only a 25. **Clinton is a 53**.  That is some buuulllllshhit 
Next year, I'm probably going to vote based on who has or hasn't got a dick.
I think the majority want her because she's the only viable Democrat currently announced.

&gt; Everywhere Religion gains control their is a tendency to slide backwards in social progress.  That hurts my head.  It seems you're falling victim to "chartism".
Just to give you some perspective, in the 2012 race Obama raised $230M from small donors (less than $200).  This was a race where he was unchallenged so essentially all small donations went to him vs being split among several candidates.  That was less than 1/4 of the total raised by his campaign.  Now 4 years the price to run has at least doubled.
Gotta say, the BERNIE SANDERS!!! enthusiasm is like the liberal version of the RON PAUL!!! enthusiasm.
Honestly, why do you? (I'm not the person you were responding to).    I don't see why she would be a better candidate than Sanders.  
Well that's not a fair argument. We don't *have* to keep this level of spending. And certain Republicans are for cutting military spending (though many don't). What I'm trying to say is you didn't really attack this person's argument, you just called it a name to discredit it.
You haven't seen the inflammatory aspect effectively achieve results? When Satanists file to distribute their literature in schools, Christian proselytizers back out a lot more quickly than if Jews had done it. It's also not like, say, Muslims are going to be received any more calmly by the population you're envisioning. Bottom line is this strategy co-opts the "I'm taking my ball and going home" mentality quickly and effectively. 
America's Economy?  The one with the largest GDP in the world? The one that has outperformed Europe for decades? The one with lower unemployment and higher standard of living that much of the industrialized world?   Of all the things you can criticize America for,  the strength of its economy is one of the dumbest imaginable.  Next up,  "Why the Hulk is a weakling!" 
Well, except for his voting record, which is very in-line with his campaign. http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm
To be fair it was not really Bush's fault either, it was a result of the financialization of capital and overspeculation that began in the 80's . Now, every single president since the 80's since 2008 agreed to this in some way or another, but that is a different story.
It's almost like "separate but equal" has a problematic history!
Ok, sign every reddit political post you make with your real name and the amount you spend on your computer and mobile devices used to post them. 
I've heard a lot of people talking about how they're disappointed in Hillary - could someone please elaborate a bit for me? I haven't been as tuned-in to the issues as I should be.
No, he just called it propaganda. He didn't disprove his points at all. Republicans, no more so than democrats, want to cultivate more "income inequality". You cannot tax yourself into prosperity.
I mean, even if you take your tongue out of your cheek, I'll admit that there are SOME benefits.  You learn to deal with people at work, to show up on time, etc.   But that's never going to get you a job as a software developer...or even as a secretary, which is only a **minor** step up from those other jobs.  I mean, who's going to hire a secretary who doesn't have much practice typing quickly, can't use a phone and doesn't have reliable non-public transport?
Illinois. A lot of blue states aren't doing so good but you get downvoted for saying it, yet when a Republican policy does bad it makes the front page.  http://www.zerohedge.com/article/32-states-now-officially-bankrupt-378-billion-borrowed-treasury-fund-unemployment-ca-mi-ny-w 
The difference is that the other article directly discusses labor standards and a bill that is currently in Congress for consideration.   The removed article here does not. 
  Because it is a very expensive and dangerous method of boiling water. What do you do with the waste, like Fukishima.
What nonsense. Respect me then, for refusing to accept funding for my backyard soda bottle rocket from Elon Musk, even though Elon Musk would never, in a million years, give me one red cent. It is very easy for Sanders to "turn his back" on funding that was never an option for him.

Being an antagonist in this situation to rile people up is pretty shitty of you to be honest.  Even so, I've seen next to nothing about the cops getting away with something and more about the criminals destroying and stealing property.  You're like the kid standing on the corner with a rock to throw, just waiting for a reason to chuck it. 
Spending your money is a statement of choice. If you don't like their opinions don't buy products from the Koch brothers company or companies that use their products. That'll have more effects than anything else. They are wealthy and there is nothing wrong in using your influence. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, FDR, JFK were all massively wealthy, and used a lot of soft money . The Koch brothers aren't household names outside of the politically in tune class of people. I dare you to find someone on the street who has any Idea what they look like or what their business does. This is political grandstanding at its worst.
&gt; He's one of the few politicians who actually take liberalism seriously  He doesn't take liberalism seriously at all, except in that he rejects it. He's a socialist, not a liberal.
Woahh dude might as well say the six cops are found not guilty if your gonna describe the victim like that
No, its the opposite. they are showing that the RFRA laws are ridiculous because it gives people Carte Blanche to violate any law they don't like and claim a religious exemption. 
Why shouldn't they be able to?

It's the safest method to produce methods and is responsible for less deaths then any other method, including solar and hydro. 
I was hoping they'd charge the police with felony murder since the arrest was illegal.  The detainment is false imprisonment and/or kidnapping and the beating or whatever it was is battery.  Second degree murder charges all around.    EDIT: I should have actually read the fucking article.  One of them did get charged with second degree murder.
Sometimes it's simply easier to give a kid a lollipop so they'll shut the fuck up.

can we state Illinois is what will happen if the Democrats are in charge  
if the op used the **actual** article headline he would of.  it's just a case of /r/politics sensationalism and bringing up race where it doesn't matter.
Ahh so the best and brightest who are most likely to benefit from these policies are going to move to a "social democrat" country because of altruism and utopia?
It's called making informed predictions based on [polling.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html)  He doesn't have a chance.  Hillary will be coronated and there's nothing /politics can do about it.
You're hilarious. Do you vote?
Conflicting messages. here.
This article seems a bit biased and salty. Is this par for the course for this subreddit?
You seem to believe that simply reading Marx causes someone to agree with him. It doesn't.  And Marxism-Leninism does not have much of a scientific background, it's idealism written by a man at a time where the understanding of the universe and even human psychology was in its infancy.  You are an idealist. You believe a single tool can fix everything. When you're a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.  I am a toolbox. I do not limit myself to only using a hammer. Different situations call for different tools. A planned market economy works in some places, a free market works in others. Class causes some problems, but not all problems.  No matter what I throw up you're going to see it as a nail because you're dedicated to being a hammer. You will twist everything into being a nail.  You have fallen into dogma, which makes you not very useful for fixing issues.  Dogma is as bad in politics as it is in religion.

Not so.  As an American independent, I see the two parties are virtually identical; the most significant differences are in which corporations control which party.  
Well, do you think he's gonna blame a Republican for what happened under a Republican's watch?  Hell, a third of Republicans in Louisiana think Obama's response to hurricane Katrina was botched.
if the stories circulating that he had surgery on his back a few weeks prior turn out to be accurate and are brought up in court, no jury is going to convict.
If you read my comment man you'll see I levied criticism toward Bush as well, and gave my high level analysis of what policy decisions by which presidents were most responsible for creating the economy we have now.  I get that you're making a joke, but it would be more accurate in my opinion to go back to the Clinton Era or the Nixon or Reagan Era than back to 2004.  I'm not even defending Bush really at all.  
Yes, any post not about the democratic party is Republican bashing. Deserved or not deserved this sub is extremely biased but whatever.

Where's ol Randy's free-market libertarian solution to inner city poverty?  Oh, the same place as these absentee fathers.
Take this to the cons that have been yelling for days "it's not racial! The liberal media pretends it is so AL sharpen and the other race pimps can keep blacks on the Democrat plantation!" 
His turning down SuperPAC money is consistent with his entire political platform.    I don't see how a man running on "corporate money out of politics" is somehow being insincere when he turns down corporate money in politics.  That's not political stageplay, that's the definition of Bernie Sanders.
That may be true, but Baltimore is predominately controlled by democrats so it's a pretty far stretch to blame republicans for what happened there.  I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy. 
You see i always thought 'white people' moved to the suburbs because houses/property &gt; apartments. 
or the facts are different from what the media's "report first, fact check later" approach is telling people.
You only say this because you are scared it might happen. Just admit it..
Don't worry; every day celebrates the struggle of the proletariat against evil and exploitative capital here on /politics.
They hold them close during election cycles, and toss them to the wolves when the check comes.
Not at all.  Where are these liberal utopias that have tax rates as low?  Especially on the middle and upper middle class.
Wow, you should read up on Islam. "Killing Infidels" is not at all what the religion is about. Just because groups such as the Taliban and ISIS claim they they are killing people in the name of their religion, does NOT mean they are actually following the tenets of the religion they claim to be fighting for. And this is from an atheist.
Satan is an major player in abrahamic religions.
Not even, this place is dominated by liberals who are just fine with regulated capitalism.  Nice try, though.
Don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out.
It's going to haunt all of us down the road.
Great idea!  We just need control of House and Senate, and to retain control of the Presidency.  So... uh... set your time machine for 2008?
I definitely don't approve of the rioting, but you do have to wonder a little bit if they would still be facing these charges if there wasn't a huge public outrcy.

Oh, and the easiest and simplist critique of Das Kapital, and Marxism in general, is that it's a non-falsifiable theory. Meaning no experiment can be constructed that if the experiment fails that the theory is disproved.  One of the cornerstones of any valid theory is that it is falsifiable. The entire range of social sciences suffers from this problem.  Something like the theory of evolution falls apart if you find an animal that shares exclusively avian and mammalian features. Einstein's theory of relativity has major problems if we observe something going faster than light.  What, if anything, could concretely put a nail in Marx's theory? If you can't give me one, it's non-falsifiable, which means it likely suffers from continual uses of the logical fallacy "moving the goal posts".
I agree! It's also interesting how conginitive dissonance causes my comment to be downvoted :-) The Baltimore City Council for instance has been 100% democratic for decades and Detroit is the best (worst?!) example of disastrous democratic management.

Where are the Soros haters?  The misery created crashing the pound sterling dwarfs anything the Koch's have ever done.  Also - its very possible Soros was behind the massive money market withdrawls that hastened the Mortgage Crash.

&gt; They had no reason to stop or arrest Gray.  I think that the officers deserve to be prosecuted for what they did, and it was completely illegal for them to arrest him.  However I want to point out that he initially ran from police, which the [supreme court ruled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_v._Wardlow) is probable cause _for detaining, questioning, and frisking a suspect_. It is **not** grounds for arresting someone. I just wanted people to clear that legally the police had reason to stop him, _but not to arrest him_.  Of course when you're planning on roughing someone up while they're restrained in your vehicle, you probably don't care what's legal.
now i know this is a lie.  no president would have the power to do this.
They clearly aren't responding well to reason.  Fuck em, force their hands (force them to either accept their religious beliefs or keep their's the fuck out of the legal system/schools/etc).  They've been around for a while, they've had time to change their minds.  It's clear something more is needed.
You'd prefer your political opinion be dictated by Reddit's /r/politics, same difference.
Something more is needed and maybe it's the right thing to do.  I'm still worried about the victims.
Which is why those laws tend to get over turned instead of progressing to the end point you describe. That's the actual mechanism of denial the Satanists are pursuing.   It's not unfair that the Satanists want a piece too. It is unfair that the law exists at all. 
Cruz was an undergrad at Princeton and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. He is so not stupid. He *is* the biggest liar to come along in decades. 
Cool story, bro.  Fortunately, this proposed regulation applies to *all* funding of campaign ads, Koch and Soros alike.
I'm poor, so I can't afford to contribute monetarily.  However, I do have time on my hands, so I have already signed up for volunteering in my area. 
My fear is that he has a better chance of beating Hillary in the primary election than winning the general election, thus giving a greater chance of a Republican winning the presidency.

You are comparing engineers to IT people and less skilled workers. If an employer finds world-class talent in foreign land, by all means, hire that person. The sad truth is middle-class and lower jobs are being done for less than can be expected of Americans.   I worked construction and these guys would come to the U.S. on a visa, live with 4 or 5 people, send almost all their money to their families back home, then would move back when their visa ran out. $8 an hour for a couple years can basically get you retired in a country like Mexico. The sad part isn't that they are siphoning money out of the country, it's the fact that they don't even want to bring their families here. I'm sure they know they're getting fucked, but in their country, they can thrive on that tiny bit of money. One guy I knew had a brand new house built in Mexico after working here for 6 months at $8 an hour. 
Which shows just how effective good trolling can be.

Your statement is absolutely untrue. You have this perception that the Democrats are the good guys and the Republicans are the bad guys, but seriously look at where the money is coming from on both sides. Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup and JPMorgan are not contributing to Hillary's capaigns for altruistic reasons.

No, trust me. That is not what will happen. 
Well hell, at least it was left by the security detail. I initially thought after reading the title, that Boehner might keep loaded guns in his bathroom on purpose.  Regardless, this is embarrassing and beyond unprofessional. 
He was injured during the arrest and they failed to get medical help.  Manslaughter. The process is already in motion.  Shame the city has already burned down
  After stomping on him and sitting on his back and neck. Kind of like a police message.

That's a nice sentiment but kids nowadays should already know everything they do or say is being saved somewhere on the internet.  If it's not being monitored by the Government it's being archived somewhere to be seen and mocked for all eternity.    Little Johnny shouldn't be surprised when his employment application is rejected after a cursory Internet search turns up all kinds of dumb shit on Facebook/YouTube/etc.
I concur.  It seems to me the other officers charges are too lite, it's as is none of them are being directly blamed for causing the injuries that led the man to die!  Rather the charges imply they all share some responsibility in allowing it to happen and then not doing anything about it, with the driver getting the more serious charge due to his indifference.    The point is this all still fits neatly into the narrative that Mr Grey caused his own injuries and I just don't buy it.
Any proof of that?  When working class Americans hear about his [proposed 13.4% payroll tax](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/american-health-security-act-of-2013?inline=file) he wants to levy on them they might be persuaded to vote GOP.
&gt;So how is Hibbs addressing the squeeze on his own business?

In theory only.

Huh, this seems to be the only submission in /r/politics with Bernie Sanders in the title that *isn't* shooting to the top of the front page.  Redditors, you can downvote reality all you want, but you won't change it.

Why? If anything that would make it more egregious. They intentionally left someone with a medical condition unstrapped in the back. He was also denied medical attention afterwards.
The fine citizens of this metropolis have not elected a Republican as mayor since 1963, before the War on Poverty began. That mayor’s 4 year term is the only interruption in Democrat rule since 1947. They have had Democrat control for 64 of the last 68 years, and sole control for the last 48 years straight. Their mayor is black. Their previous mayor, Sheila Dixon, was black. She was convicted of embezzlement in 2010 and couldn’t finish her term. They had a white mayor (current Democratic Presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley) for eight years. The mayor before him was black. Their City Council consists of 15 members. All fifteen are Democrats. The Council President is black. Democrats have had control of legislation in Baltimore for the last 50 years. Every program, policy, initiative, or school curriculum that exists in Baltimore was enacted by liberal Democrats. The Police Commissioner is black. Approximately 50% of the police force is black. The School Superintendent is black, along with the School Board. The district has an annual budget of $1.32 billion to teach 84,000 kids. The Baltimore school system ranks second among the nation’s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil at $15,700 per student. Only NYC spends more. Only two thirds of students graduate high school, despite this high level of spending. The average SAT scores of Baltimore City public school students are: 379 in Reading; 376 in Math; 381 in Writing. These are the scores of the best of the best in Baltimore schools who actually think they should get into college. The average scores in the country, which still suck, are around 500. Students with these scores have about a 15% chance of graduating college. This is the ROI you get after spending $188,000 per student over their 12 year academic career. The population of Baltimore is 623,000 and 63% are black. Median household income is $41,000, with 24% living below the poverty line. The home ownership rate is 48%. The percentage of college graduates is 27%. The population was 950,000 in 1950, so it has fallen by 35% in the last 65 years. The population was 24% black in 1950. Decades of liberal Democrat policies drove most of the white population out of the city. Baltimore’s violent crime rate is 370% higher than the U.S. rate. They have over 200 murders, 300 rapes, 3,600 robberies, 4,600 assaults, 7,800 burglaries, and 22,000 thefts per year. These are all 2 to 4 times the U.S. averages per 100,000 people. Over 35% of all Baltimore residents get food stamps. Over 85% of the kids get free breakfasts and lunches at school. More than 60% of Baltimore residents are receiving some form of government assistance. Baltimore’s welfare paradise is paid for by outrageously high taxes. It’s income tax rate of 3.2% is on top of the state rate of 4.75%. It’s property tax rate is more than double the other counties in Maryland. The sales tax rate is 6%. Corporations pay an income tax rate of 8.25%. The percentage of out of wedlock births to black women in Baltimore exceeds 72%. Baltimore and Detroit are the two cities with populations over 600,000 with the highest percentage of single parent households – 59% to 61%. The reported unemployment rate for Baltimore is 8.2%, one of the highest in the country. In reality, 42% of the working age population is not working. Young black men between the ages of 20 and 24 have a reported unemployment rate of 37%. But in reality, it is north of 60%. The number of employees in 1990 totaled 475,000. Today they total 365,000, down 23%.
The fact is it's ineffective anyway.  Most people have already chosen a side before they even know the candidates.  The so called "swing" voters are low information voters who might be influenced by ads but aren't going to care who funds them.  They're not going to bust out the magnifying glass to read a list of donors, which is sure to be in the most minuscule typeface possible, and do some googling.  We need to actually put a stop to this avenue of election funding.  
&gt; I don't hear anything about the lack of chance Scott Walker has becoming president or Marco Rubio. Just Bernie.  Because those two have chances.  Bernie doesn't.    &gt; Something much more sinister is going on here.  No. People just won't want Bernie.  He's the most liberal senator for a reason: because his politics don't sell well nationwide.
Finally, someone is writing about the awesome gyrocopter guy.

&gt;Dr. King style riots  Did you mean that there would be peaceful protests? Or are you under the impression MLK advocated rioting as some people did in Baltimore? Because if it's the latter, you're simply wrong.
Where do you get a home for a family for $800/month?
LOL
Ah, yes, "Satan".  A name that should mean nothing to you if you don't buy into the Xtian mythos.  I don't disagree that the inclusion of the word "satan" gives people pause, but that in itself should tell you how very all-pervasive the christian indoctrination is in our culture, and how desperately we need to shake ourselves free of the shackles of mindless superstition.
when did i become a democrat?  why does it seem like one party is actually doing things that make sense.  last year it seemed that both sides were insane.  lol oh well.  GO SANDERS!!!
With that attitude, we should simply drop it and agree to disagree.
That would require an informed electorate, which is an oxymoron. People are not coerced into voting for either candidate, they choose to vote. The wealthy and elite classes have always ruled, and when they crashed, new one rose to take their place. The Koch Brothers spent 2.2 million according to [mother jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/charts-map-koch-brothers-2012-spending) in 2012, The SEIU spent 68.3 million in 2012 according to [factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2014/02/service-employees-international-union-seiu-3/). Tom Steyer spent 85$ Million in [2014](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/election-results-tom-steyer-greens-112556.html) all of it going to democrats while the Kochs spent about [7 million of their money give or take](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php). Billionaires arent homogenous in their thinking, and opensecrets.org shows this. Billionaires don't get presidents elected, the party does. it drives a ground game that gets people to the polls. Ads don't get people elected, people on the ground do. The organization built around a campaign is the most important part of the effort.  
If only it applied to people like Freddie Gray in the same way it does to the cops. I don't think the cops will have to worry about getting a rough ride while unbuckled in the back of a police van. 
Do you think that they should have professors that believe the world is flat? You know, for balance?  A factual understanding of the world leads to liberal politics. There may be some exceptions, but if you're hiring people based on their understanding of factual evidence and the world around them, you're going to get more Democrats.
Lengthy.  So he gave a number of reason, as opposed to just one.
you are missing a very vital point. if a group of people band together to break the law and literally bring the city to a screeching halt, you don't encourage it.  you don't say "we heard you and we're giving you what you want", as that encourages more of that crap. you ignore them, and proceed exactly as you would if there were no riots, and sure as hell don't give them a shoutout when announcing the charges.  the prosecutor was effectively condoning the riots with that being part of the announcement.
After MLK was killed there were riots in baltimore. I think Thats what he meant 
Are you forgetting the NRA is in charge of the Republican party now? They tell them which appointments to block or allow, where to gin up fear to increase gun sales, and when they want tax free days to sell more guns. 
Seems Simon knows what he's talking about.
Good. But when they get acquitted there will be another riot.. Police never get found guilty. It's fucking pathetic. 
Seeing as how it's not near a fault line nor in any risk of being hit by a giant wave, I'm not really sure why being a similar design is a bad thing? The Japanese reactor avoided a meltdown even tho it was hit by a giant earthquake followed by a giant wave. 
Seriously?  The contention is that money buys elections so people who want to do bad things have more freedom to do bad things.  Soros caused more suffering than the anything Koch's ever did.  The first point there is factual framing of the over-arching issue here.  The second is fairly empirical in nature with some opinion.  Why are you afraid to acknowledge that Soros is as toxic as you think the Koch's are? 
This is worth more then money. Good for you!

Ok, but let's get human rights down first please 
Wow.  It must be comforting to live in such a black and white world.  Perhaps you too would have benefited by being more exposed to Republicans (outside of the hyper-political world of reddit).  This is exactly why diversity is so important.
And I'd imagine if you are a foreign company but have a regional headquarters that is actually incorporated in the US (like a subsidy), that subsidy would be perfectly fine in donating as well.
It's a nice thought, but lets be honest here. Most people already have everything they do on the internet. We all know once it goes up it doesn't really come down. If you don't upload it yourself someone you know does. It's a fact of life anymore with social media.  Edit: Apparently I should make myself clear, i didn't say that i was against dismantling the NSA. I am simply saying that kids will grow up with their entire lives online regardless of if it is dismantled or not. You can already follow some children from birth on Facebook, every little thing they've done is uploaded by their parents.
we will never be able to remove money from politics entirely, but removing direct campaign contributions and preventing super pacs would put us in a better place then we are now with very minimal impact to the first amendment.  
  Was Chernobyl underwater too. How about 3 Mile Island.?

"I don't see color" and "I look at facts" are contradictory statements.
I do not care what you say. I only care that i know who the fuck is saying it.  Let me decide on the information i have if i can trust what you are saying. Do not hide from me. You are trying to get into my head, to breach into my personal space, to make me vote for something YOU want. The least i can ask is to know who you are.  At no point i'm taking away your right to say whatever it is you want and to pay for whatever it is you want to pay. 
Ron Paul.  Btw, note of caution on assessing parties&amp;politicians based on votes.   The people that run the show are clever enough to maintain an illusion of choice, democracy, and dissent. When a lawmaker's vote is not needed (law will pass or fail anyways) they are then permitted to vote in a way that panders to their constituents (or supporter base) wishes and ideology. However, on those occasions when the corrupt party leadership really needs to get business done for their key backers, like Wall St, they can and do twist arms and play hardball to bring their members to heel.  So, keep in mind some votes are "gimmes." It's actually harder than just looking at how someone voted to figure out how good or bad someone is. Were they bucking the party leadership's wishes?  Just pandering to their base cause they could?  Etc.
No.  I don't have any "proof" about how the super-secretive NSA operates.
&gt; ...if you are going to donate money, it should be in your own name. Companies are not people.  I could not agree more. I don't think any non-human entity should be allowed to donate to political campaigns. Companies aren't people, they're made of people who already have a voice.  &gt;as is the electoral college.  I also agree. It's nonsensical that Wyoming gets three votes while Colorado gets nine, despite having ten times the population of Wyoming. I think it's fair to say that people who currently don't vote could be incentivized to vote if they knew their vote for the president counted as equally as every other Americans.  &gt;But above all, we need to get rid of this two-party system.  I think that moving away from FPTP would be enough to get away from the two party dominance that we see now. And even if it didn't, a two party system wouldn't be as bad as it is under FPTP. If you had three Republicans and three Democrats running in a Senate race you still technically have a two party race, but you've got different degrees of adherence to that parties stances, which is almost as good.
OK; someone has to clear this up for me.  The mayor, the police commissioner, the state attorney, the city council, the general assembly, house of delegates, state senate, US House of Representatives and the US Senate.  Each and every one of those positions for Baltimore is, and has for quite some time, been filled by liberal democrats.  In most of these cases, these folks are minorities.  These folks are in charge of the quality of life for the people in the greater Baltimore area.  That is their job.  Quite obviously, this job has not been getting accomplished to the satisfaction of the local population.  Since that is the case, my question would seem to be obvious:  how in the world is this a RACE issue???  Those folks in the street should be screaming mad at their OWN leaders, the ones who have been PROMISING to improve their lives time immemorial in return for their votes, but in turn have given them NOTHING!!!  They haven't improved their prospect for a better life!  They haven't improved their schools!  They improved their job prospects!  Welfare and food stamps don't improve lives!  They teach dependence!  This whole thing just confounds me; these people don't seem to know who they should actually be mad at...

Who said anything about low tax rates elsewhere? I said if we're going to pay taxes, we'd like something of value for them.   Did you mean to respond to me?
Here you go bud!                                                                                                                               [According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics] (http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf), black offenders committed 52 per cent of homicides recorded in the data between 1980 and 2008.

Wow, so much hatred and bile in one place.  I'm talking bout the article, not necessarily the speech. 
&gt; atheistic satanists  Do you realize the hypocrisy there?  If one reveres Satan as a god-like creature, they're not exactly *atheist*.  (Though, to be fair, most satanists *don't* revere Satan as such a high power)  &gt; This 'religion' has no cultural or historical clout and is clearly designed to provoke and offend.  It appears you are completely ignorant of the tenets of the Church of Satan.  Why not do some research into the religion you're supposedly arguing against before you spew an ignorant opinion?  Worried that it might cloud your already-skewed worldview?
yes fast typing, thanks, chiki.
Hopefully someone sells them out. I'll be happy if most of them burn.
Theories need to be tested.
If you think Ted Cruz actually believes that then you are as delusional as the nitwits who sincerely believe every crack-pot thing he says. This is all about raising campaign cash and then dropping out with a nice war chest for re-election, a PAC and maybe the VP slot. IRCC Texas allows its senators to run for re-election while campaigning for another office and Cruz has not ruled out running for re-election (which the media is being very coy about not addressing). 
&gt; Was Chernobyl underwater too. How about 3 Mile Island.?  Both were mismanaged, Chernobyl horrifically, and both are included in the statistic.  Clearly you'd prefer to use emotion than science and numbers to govern energy policy.  What else would you like to use to power the world?  Coal?  Or maybe magic and unicorns?  &gt; pile up mega tons of radioactive waste that will bite us the next weather or quake problem comes along. perhaps we should chop the waste into tiny portions and feed it to the poor  Or you can act like a big kid and learn what a breeder reactor is.
The damn thing is called K.O.C.H. so guy, you are completely wrong.  It is more than germane....why are the Koch's singled out then?  
&gt;Murray is the author of the highly influential 1984 book Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950-1980 which argued that social welfare programs of the 1960s and 1970s actually hurt the poor rather than helped. It was and remains a seminal work in the conservative policy canon.  Most people think the way they were brought up and lived is the norm.  And there's this myth among conservatives that everyone has the same opportunities and all you need to do is work and success is yours for the taking.  They don't understand how much pure chance is involved.  Jeb here was lucky enough to be born in a very old wealthy WASP family.  You'd have to *really* fuck up (George W sure did try!) *not* to be a success. 
I guess no need for a trial since you've already deemed them guilty. So much for "innocent"until proven guilty. 
Their behavior is on repeat here, this is always happening. So why is the military so strongly Republican?
really you think California is doing well
No.
What possible issue does Hillary advocate for that Elizabeth warren wouldn't be better at?    Hillary is the money candidate just like Jeb bush if you think those two dynasty families don't have a lot in common you are completely delusional.  
Do we need to start asking suspects to fill out a medical questionnaire before arresting them?  
According to the Satanic Temple (the specific branch of Satanism mentioned in the article): It is the position of The Satanic Temple that religion can, and should, be divorced from superstition. As such, we do not promote a belief in a personal Satan. http://thesatanictemple.com/about-us/faq/  Yes I do realize the hypocrisy, this is why I think this is a bunch of BS. 
I'm from Wisconsin. He's ruining the state. And I used to like him. We're getting so far behind in terms of jobs and economic health and now soon to be education. Our collegiate system is(was) a major positive for our state.. I can't back anything he's done in the last year or two.
Hail Satan!  
I'm fairly certain you understood the point of my post, but you completely failed to address it. I'll ask again, with just a tad bit less snark.... What makes one religion anymore legitimate than another? Every religion is convinced that their story is right and everyone else's is wrong, so what makes any one legitimate than any other? With regard to religious freedom, why should my sincerely held beliefs be treated any different than yours?  
Which is why everyone voted against minimum wage increases in Red States in 2014, I'm sure. Oh wait...
Exactly.  However it doesn't look like the system is to blame in this one.  
I really don't think facts matter in this case.  The people of Baltimore want a specific outcome, not justice.  
&gt;Billionaires don't get presidents elected, the party does. it drives a ground game that gets people to the polls. Ads don't get people elected, people on the ground do. The organization built around a campaign is the most important part of the effort.  If ads don't help people get elected, then why do campaigns continue to spend more and more money on ads? Lets look at it a different way, in the free market companies like Coke, Apple, McDonalds, the entire pharma industry, etc. spend huge sums of money on advertising. These companies clearly see advertising as a way to influence behavior and achieve the results they desire, why would an election be different?  Secondly, you talk about how the "ground game" actually determines the election. Where do you think the money for the ground game and organization comes from (hint: donors).  Also, nice try with the slight-of-hand on the 2012 election spending. The Mother Jones article you reference goes into great detail on how much the Koch's spent on the election. You should actually [read it](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/charts-map-koch-brothers-2012-spending). Or try the [HuffPo article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/koch-brothers-100-million-obama_n_1250828.html) on the same topic.  &gt;A source who was in the room when the pledges were made told The Huffington Post that, specifically, Charles Koch pledged $40 million and David pledged $20 million.
&gt; I am actually fairly exposed to Republicans. I have Republicans in my family who I care deeply about. None of them are qualified to teach at Harvard.  Wow again!  That's your rationale for claiming that Republicans aren't qualified to teach at Harvard?
According to the Constitution.  We all should roll that way.
It's 13.4%.  Any cost associated with employment goes into compensation.  The employer won't just take its 6.7% out of thin air.
Technically not really, you see a pretty clear economic pattern of fuck ups post Clinton and then Obama adopted the shit show that is the Senate locking out any legislation and all of the debt W. put us in.  (Let alone all of those jobs made for Iraq that people depend on that need to be cut.)
If money was the problem, why do no liberals complain about Soros who dumps waaay more money into politics then Koch bros. Thats right, it is about censorship just like most liberal policies. 
I did the same thing with BP stock shortly after the oil spill.  "They're not going to have to pay appropriately for this."  Would have been happy to lose that money.
I think it was pretty east to understand what he meant
&gt;I'm not going to address such an irrational and sensationalist fear of fictional holy war, as it's patently absurd.  Isn't that the only thing your last comment did?
oh I didn't know all the parks were open  my bad must be amazing there  Lol
The people who upload everything they do on the internet only have themselves to blame, I've never used Facebook/Myspace/Google+/Twitter/whatever the latest fads are, and no one I know really posts about me (I'm guessing because it would be inconvenient and pointless since I'm not on their social media with them).  I personally would like for my information to be as private as I make it, without people being able to collect it without my knowing.
OK, I get it.  Diversity in liberal institutions doesn't extend to conservatives.  Good day sir.
the "quippy attack" was simply a short way of saying that - at least that's how I took it.
  Heard that for many decades. It takes a decade to get a nuke plant in and zillions of dollars. The first casualties are construction cost estimates and time promises. Not anti science but the ability to see the truth. Nuke is a terrible waste of time and money that creates problems that will exist when man is no longer here.
Sounds like a place where everything is explained like I'm five.
If there are no riots, no one pays attention and the media focuses on Bruce Jenner.  If there are riots, the media focuses on the problem but innocent people get screwed over in the process.  The happy medium is that the public, the government and the media prioritizes what is important and fix problems in a pragmatic way.  Obviously that is not going to happen anytime soon so we fall into the same shitty cycle
I understand the concept in large urban areas (New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago) for the need of solidarity among the cops because it can end up feeling like war out there (everyone against you) but at the same time, it comes off like the stuff Unions had done in the past that got them a bad label.  In both cases it looks past corruption in favor off the group / party. It feels like a repeat failure in America. We see it all the time in the pollitical parties, but it's not as threatening like in this case with the cops going after a "snitch" or threatening a DA's life for the sake of the Department.  I remember watching "Serpico", and while the movie is only based on actual events, Frank Serpico was real. The vilification of someone trying to be honest and descent was real...   Solidarity doesn't have shit to do with being kept honest. Decency and humanity are what the Police are supposed to be trying to protect and serve and we're taught it's what they're supposed to embody. That ain't happening. No one's perfect, but too much from the barrel comes off rotten at this point., and they don't like fresh ones pointing it out.
What about people who post my personal information online? What about people who take creep shots of me while I'm in a vulnerable position and posting it on reddit? That cool? That still okay? Because that is way more invasive and damaging to me than the NSA knowing I liked Dominos on facebook. 
Sadly this is part of the general pack, bro, group think what ever you want to call it that things like the police force, military, and others services breed slash require.  You need to think of your self as part of this group and that the group is superior to all, especially when dealing with threats from outside the group.  It is useful in situations like the police because in building that loyalty to the group and other members means you will protect them as if they were your own family.  The downside is that by reporting your fellow officer you have broken the trust of the family.    And before you judge I want you to think honestly about your own family or very very close friends.  If you knew they were doing something illegal, say a minor drug distribution ring,and reported them to the police or other government agencies for it what would the reaction be from the rest of your family or group of friends.    I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying it's something built into the human instincts due to it helping us survive when we were in the hunter gather days, and everyone has it.  
The Illuminati won't let him win.
What a stupid bitch. 
The only reason they made him resign is because he tipped their hand. If he'd done what he's supposed to, and not got caught telling cops to murder people, he'd still have a job. 
&gt;Who's going to pay attention to the list of donors written in minuscule typeface slammed into the last half second of a political ad?  I don't think anyone will, at first - but, when people notice that they keep hearing the *same* names, over and over, to the point where they start to realize how many of the ads from all these different, benevolent sounding groups are actually just the same few rich people talking, they will start to be unsettled by it.
Chelsey 2024 
I like that he is going to try, but the flat point is that getting rid of US Government spying just isn't going to go away.  He is doing this for numbers, and it is kind of sad.
The riots worked.
The only people who have even heard about Tides are Glen Beck listeners.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides_(organization). They are relatively insignificant.  Their total endowment is less than the Koch brothers plan on spending in 2016.
What the fuck are leg irons? These people legitimately fancy themselves as slave masters don't they?  I don't understand how people can be this fucking broken. If they are guilty, throw them in jail forever to make a point, I honestly don't care anymore.
The thing was, nationalization wasn't going to be backed by any politician, especially a Republican administration.  
If he wins primary, we lose the general election.  It is pretty much a fact, this man is only going to hurt the left.  He is too old, and not charismatic enough to run(not that Hillary is on either counts as well).  The main thing is that the country wants to vote for a woman, you can tell that they are ready.
Unfortunately, my state's primary is completely meaningless. I live in one of the last states latest on the primary calendar. By the time our primary rolls around, the candidate has usually already been mathematically decided.
Did you make a mistake [or are you just a liar](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3064367/Baltimore-State-Attorney-says-criminal-charges-filed-against-officers-Gray-s-arrest-illegal-knife-carrying-lawful.html)?
My knowledge of presidential powers is pretty limited, but I don't think that the President of the United States had the power to stop people from taking creep shots.
So you don't do anything then?  Sounds a lot like the reason not to prosecute Wall Street post crash.
No, it's just that I feel like I'm watching a child argue with an adult. That's why you're not getting detailed responses.   I'm glad your family is doing well, but that has little to do with the conversation. I said you're privileged, not your elders.   I'm not personally attacking you, I'm saying that you don't appear to have the life experience to have this conversation.   You think 95% of people can just move in with mom and dad and save tons of money? No. It's not nearly that high of a number. The fact that you think so implies that you are basing this off personal experience. People tend to be surrounded by those closest to their class, so 95% of the people *you* know ha e this privilege but definitely not most. 
Please let this happen!
I do not support the NSA.   But I think it's somewhat naive to believe that in the age of our technological breakthroughs, our government will not do everything it can to advance its surveillance capabilities in tandem.  It makes sense given the purpose of the government and the effect of surveillance. It's a rather natural progression regardless of how we, as citizens, view it.  The NSA proves that infinite surveillance will be used improperly, but many things in our daily lives prove that a lack of surveillance is inconvenient, problematic, and sometimes deadly. Cops without body cameras, cars without dash cams, the ability for Hillary Clinton's correspondence to go entirely unchecked as Secretary of State.  Surveillance solves a great many problems and introduces a great many new ones. More importantly, as technology progresses, it becomes more and more inevitable.  I recommend approaching this discussion in a more nuanced way than just "aggregate information collection bad."  (I will still be voting for and volunteering for Bernie, and I do still hate the NSA)
Good.  It's about time these freeloading poors paid their fair share, anyway.
No. That isn't what I said then either.  The problem is, you're so defensive about your belief system you are no more fair or rational than the christians.  You don't want to read what I wrote, you want to read false persecution and get angry over it.
So did Obama.
You glossed over free will like it's not a real argument. But that's the whole point of modern interpretation.   God made Angels, perfect creatures without free will. Then mankind, with free will. Satan's sudden jealousy is because God wanted to test free will and faith. Ostensibly all existence from our original evolution has been a game, a test of free will. 
Welcome to /r/berniessanders
He changed his mind, he's only hum, damn. 
Never happen. The machine will never ever let it happen, they will bar him or lie or both, but have fun with your fairy tale till then.
I'm sure u/LOTM42 is making an assumption based on Grays extensive lists of arrests that include burglary, drug sales and manufacturing.

The thing is, I think Bernie has a greater chance than Hillary if he manages to win out over her.  For one, I think he will do very well in debates, when people actually get to hear his views.  If he manages to win over Hillary, it will end up being a hot topic and get a lot of attention.  And perhaps most importantly, I think Bernie will be able to get people out and voting.  It seems a lot of the time people (especially younger people), aren't motivated to vote when they have to choose something that is 'less bad', but when someone people actually likes is running, I think he'll be able to get people out to actually vote, which is one of the main problems Dems have.  On a side note, I think if Hillary wins over Bernie, it will convince a lot of people to come out just to vote against her.
A lot of what Bernie Sanders says I have no problem with, but his pro Israel stance is a dealbreaker. I'll be voting Green. 
&gt; Unless you don't like what they might choose eh?  A woman should be able to do *whatever the fuck* she wants with her own body without the state (what you Americans usually call "government") telling her what she can do with her body. States telling women they cannot get abortions is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow women to do whatever the fuck she wants with her body, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.  A man or a woman should be able to marry *whoever the fuck* they want regardless of the gender of their partner without the state telling them who they can or cannot marry. States telling men women they cannot marry people of the same gender is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow men and women to  marry whoever the fuck they want, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.  &gt;States being able to decide for themselves what is considered legal is more freedom, it's less centralized control, and that's a good thing.  In my view the individual rights set out in the Constitution trump the separation of powers or states' rights any day of the week, month or year. A war was fought over this, and those who thought that states rights should trump civil rights lost decisively.  &gt;Realizing that some (many) issues are too important and too polarizing to leave up to an elite few in Washington is being a friend to freedom.  Except that "elite few" are also known as the "Founding Fathers," and they tried to build a liberal (as in "liberty") democracy with a robust set of civil individual rights. Allowing states to violate those rights is contrary to what the Founding Fathers would have wanted, it is anti-liberty, it is allowing the state (as in "government" and as in "state in the union") to quash civil rights over some pathetic turf war with the federal government.  &gt;He's saying it's not up to him and a handful of politicians in DC to decide, and that's the correct position to take.  Actually., Rand Paul is **against** both abortion and gay marriage. He is **against** liberties and civil rights. He simply tries to frame it as a "states' rights" issue because gullible people buy into that rhetoric and still think he is a "libertarian" despite the fact that he wants to actively deny people liberties.  &gt;It makes no difference how he personally feels about them.   This is a bad excuse to give someone who shouts "freedom" and "liberty" from the rooftops, yet is against freedom and liberty for a huge portion of the population a free pass.  You should hold your political heroes to much higher standards or they will just end up disappointing you in the end.

Taxation boils down to one simple thing ---- it can spur an economy by spending money that others don't want to let go.  If people paying more are job creators, that means they have businesses and will see this money return to them if they are doing right.  In a sense this IS capitalism, just with a little nudge.
Everything we do online is recorded and analyzed, and kids should be aware of that.   It doesn't make a big difference, to me, whether it is analyzed by a private corporation or the a law enforcement agency.

Man the idiot religtards have opened a Can of worms.
&gt;  Frank Serpico was real.  And he [wrote an article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/the-police-are-still-out-of-control-112160.html) on this topic just a few months ago.
I'm all for reeling in domestic spying, but dismantling the WHOLE NSA? The NSA gives us a profound advantage over our adversaries through foreign surveillance. 
So you're taking your vote away from someone who could actually positively affect our political system just because he's Jewish. 
this should be higher  reddit is in full jizz mode and this guy will say anything to make them cum  edit: 1,000,000 UPVOTES IF I'M ELECTED 
&gt;Clinton on her march toward an inevitable Democratic primary victory.    Wow, quite confident for over a year in the future.
This is the same crappy website that predicted Brazil was going to win the World Cup.
Facebook and Google aren't going to throw you in jail for saying something they don't like.  There's a big difference between private surveillance and government surveillance.
What a title...  
What is he sacrificing for our betterment?
I wonder how long this circlejerk can continue. 
I feel the same way at 28 and I know I will be volunteering. Spread the word and don't accept when people say he can't win because no one knows him. That attitude needs to stop.
Just curious as to why you think the ACA is a "landmark achievement".
Then he gets in the Whitehouse and is taken to the theater room and shown the Kennedy assassination from an angle never before seen. He gets asked 'any questions' and he response: "Just what my agenda is going to be"   I'm Dennis Leary and I made this up. 
You don't want to remove the rights, just tax the use of them.
Eh, it comes from the people wishing they could be Bernie Sander's personal jizz rag.  The people in /r/politics of late want to suck his dick, they want it so badly.
The fact that he referenced Orwell tells me that he gets it.
You can believe whatever you want. You can believe Obama is secretly a unicorn. It's still absurd.
 Bernie's ideas are resonate with conservatives equally well - I'm in the bible belt heartland America and the reaction is amazing once people take the time to learn what he really wants instead of listening to spin.  Edit: you can down vote me all you want - this game is going to be won on the ground - goood old shoe leather - $ 2.5 billion can't beat shoe leather, it just can't,  Senator Sanders will be the next president,  as far as I can tell 
Everyone point and laugh!
It's a shame that Hilary Clinton will likely be the democratic candidate just because she has a vagina.
I don't usually follow the reddit hive mind since it's bullshit most of the time, but fuck it, Bernie's got my vote.
Agreed.  This wreaks of pandering to me.  Dont get me wrong, I love Bernie and I think he would make a great president, but I highly doubt he could succeed at taking down the NSA as president.  We dont need bullshit campaign promises.
First of all, this isn't Saudi Arabia.  Secondly, I never made any distinction between the two, I just noted that while younger people seem to be mortified about NSA spying they don't seem to worry so much about any other external agency using the information they are self-publishing against them.  As I wrote earlier:  &gt;  If it's not being monitored by the Government it's being archived somewhere
Yes and why does the MSM propaganda/news keep talking about Christie as he is even fit for the job? 
Well you can try to beat the guy who is much heavier than you and probably even have a realistic shot at it. But we still have weight classes in sports because otherwise it would not be **fair**.  In politics revealing huge cash donors does not put them in an unfair position. They still have a very big advantage. But it does give a small guy a little bit better chance in a fight against them.  
No he wouldn't. Being elected president doesn't make you supreme dictator for life who can completely change how the government functions. This isn't how the world works. And even if he did somehow change these things, the next president would bring it back.
People made a huge deal about McCain being too old for presidency yet Sanders is a a year older than McCain was in 2008...?
Crawford as well, amazing that we are blue sometimes.
No.
Excuse us, but the animals here were the pigs who murdered an innocent man.  It was not animals who burned down the city; it was a group of people who are the constant victims of brutality and other oppressive shit.  Somehow you hit a man in the head over and over again, deny him an education, tell him he is a nigger, punish him harder than you punish others and you expect him not to lash out from time to time.  I do hope you come to a better understanding of what is actually at work in the world, or that your karma comes at the hand of LEO.
&gt; My employer can't afford to give their employees all a 14% raise  they wouldn't need to pay employers 14% more. i don't know where you got that idea from.  &gt; would likely lose significant business if they raised prices to cover the shortfall  if labor costs go up, say, 7% and labor accounts for 20% of costs (which is pretty high), then we are talking about a 1.4% increase in prices needed to compensate. additionally, having single payer means a lot of people don't need insurance anymore, which increases people's income. this can, in turn, increase demand for your business, depending on your business and demographic.  &gt; The result would be people getting laid off.  you are not considering the plethora of options that are available if an employer sees an increase in costs that isn't compensated by an increase in revenue.

TIL democrat = always Detroit.
And what did you do to deserve them? 
Why would we do that? White people are not all united. Many of us white people side with the protesters, and even the rioters. I do not understand how a group of people that is shit upon like blacks in america do not riot every single day.  
Ok, guess you're smarter than me.
Would be pretty effing hypocritical if he took money from large contributors. It is antithetic to his entire platform.

&gt; Don't be apathetic, don't vote strategically.  Ehhh... Don't be apathetic, but do vote strategically if it comes down to it. Vote Bernie in the primaries, but if he loses there and Hillary more closely matches your views than the R candidate, vote Hillary.
I've heard claims such as yours but just haven't seen those positive changes on a personal level. Any problems with your insurance plan are amplified because now the provider and the Marketplace point the finger at each other, so figuring out a billing issue is a massive undertaking almost on par with passing this legislation in the first place (joking).  Also, my wife is in medical school and assists very low-income families. One woman barely makes any money and lives in a terrible neighborhood, yet she pays $400 a month for coverage! For HERSELF!
&gt; "Physics" doesn't cause things to move or change. It just describes the means by which things move or change.  Fair enough. Interactions with other things causes things to change, and it happens according to the rules we try to figure out through science or, sometimes in the case of humans, through introspection when that produces more useful results. I'm not sure it makes sense to even ask 'why' at any higher level than that.  &gt;This isn't a question of usefulness. I'm asking if it's true.  According to a certain set of axioms, yes.
These overarching and blatantly outlandish statements are as bad as Tea Part rhetoric. But because it's to the left, reddit loves it. I'm not conservative by any means, but this is just as ridiculous as anything the right has said.
It should be. He's been [fighting for civil rights since the 1960s](http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2015/04/29/399818581/5-things-you-should-know-about-bernie-sanders). Here's [more](http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Civil_Rights.htm) on his civil rights stances.  &gt; Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "It was a question for me of just basic justice — the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African Americans who couldn't vote, who couldn't eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn't get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing," he told the Burlington Free Press. "That was clearly a major American injustice and something that had to be dealt with."
Couldn't hurt... if making memes is what you are talented at, then go at it. Who's to say only lawn posters matter?

Yes, the black police force, black police chief, and black mayor fancy themselves slave masters. You figured it out.
those stories are nothing more than racist rumors circulating right wing blogs.
I fully agree. It radical horseshit 
That's one thing I'll never understand about party politics.  The whole "Our team is best team" mentality.  I mean if we are talking about general candidates or Hillary herself, fine bring that up, but we aren't even talking about Presidential Candidates atm.  
Everyone here knows Ron Paul has been around for like 500 years, right? 
I like the comment about wondering if the governor doesn't have the backbone to stand up to them...the governor of Texas is paralyzed, he literally doesn't have the backbone to stand up to them...low blow
The government won't do that either, you know.
Its to bad someone like Ted Cruz whos out of his mind and polling at 5 percent gets so much press for his announcement. Then a true patriotic statesman whos principles are undeniable gets almost nothing.  Good luck Bernie! The last thing we should have is another Clinton/Bush election. 
Well he seriously believes in the "Women make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes and we should bring this number to $1" thing, which has been proven to be false. So he's not right on literally every issue. 
Not to mention they gave millions to the GOP.
i don't like either one, but there is a big difference in the way the could potentially exploit that information, corporations are trying to make a buck, gov't is trying to control you.
Illinois (along with most democratic states) generates more federal funding then they receive back in spending. in fact Illinois is 3d place in terms of funding per dollar generated. 
he did this how?
&gt;Sheltered white Reddit liberals, so adorable.  Police apologetic white reddit conservatives, so embarrassing.
I like them even more now! 
that is most certainly the case. not only is that data being sold to marketers, which is technically fine be me, its much more nefarious. Be sure that if you happen to piss someone off who happens to be in power, he or she can have the nsa dig up records of you liking that one funny racist video in 2011 and thus publicly shame you into obedience..  that after all is the goal of the program, to stop "terrorists", formerly known as educated democratic citizens, from challenging the powers that be
or, you know, because she's spent decades in government, is (was?) secretary of state, has tremendous foreign policy experience, and is an extremely intelligent, powerful, and capable woman?  But yeah man, because she has a vagina, okay.  I'm all for Sanders and he will get my vote twice, but let's not be sexist pigs if our guy loses by opting out of the big money.
Now let's do that a thousand more times and we might be able to compete with Hillary's money. 
sure they are, just as useful as the uks agencies spying on americans but not their own citizens, and then both agencies, accidently swapping data...  i mean, accidents happen, and look at all the terrorist plots they stopped, remember before 2001, when terrorists were literally killing millions of americans every single year on US soil...  Thank god for the nsa and the patriot act...
The government will throw you into jail if you're making threats or talking about doing something that's illegal, but the government doesn't imprison political dissidents for their opinions alone. 
I think variety is good, I'm a Libertarian, so I like Bernie's stances on NSA spying, and the drug war. But everything else I can't support out of principle. So on one hand I would never contribute to him, because of the effects I think he policies will have on the health of society, but I still think he plays an instrumental value in adding to the debate. Part of what sabotaged Ron Paul's 2012 campaign was the crazy factor, which Im seeing plenty of in the Sanders camp, the deification of candidates makes me cringe, don't do it with Bernie. Or do. :)
Maybe he ran from the cops like Freddie did?
Issue:  Whether an individual who suddenly and without provocation flees from identifiable police officers patrolling a high crime area creates reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment for the police to stop him.  Is a person's sudden and unprovoked flight from identifiable police officers, patrolling a high crime area, sufficiently suspicious to justify the officers' stop of that person?   Holding:  In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court held in a 5 to 4 decision that the police had reasonable suspicion to justify the stop.  You really believe that the judge will allow a jury to disregard a Supreme Court decision?  Have you ever watched a trial?
Sells more newspapers, if you will.
God dammit people.  Don't get fooled again. That's all I'm saying.  *No candidate for President will do what they say. That's how it works.* 
Um, terrorism? China? Russia? Iran? North Korea?   You don't see how knowing what they're saying is advantageous?
Oh you have to sign many times? You've convinced me.
Not really, given McCain was running with the same ideas. 
Curious that Politifact makes this all about Limbaugh rather than about the report he was quoting from.
itshappening.jpg  Now lets just hope the charges actually stick, and these fuckers get what they deserve. Officers who commit crime while on duty should get 2x as long sentencing, and yet the reality is they rarely get punished if at all. Even for murder.
So would Rand Paul, but nobody on /r/politics cares because of the "R" next to his name.
&gt;Sometimes I feel like liking/disliking videos in youtube is being tracked.  How do you think video recommendations work? Algorithms look at your previous history as well as what videos you liked and disliked and cross reference it with users with a similar profile. Then recommend you videos those people liked, but you haven't seen yet.    To be fair, I don't think anyone is using this kind of data to try to figure out what kind of preferences certain individuals have. What the NSA does do if they have the data (and really, they probably do) is run querries that are likely to reveal users that are in some sense dangerous. Ideally, these would be violent extremists but in practice it wouldn't be hard to create querries that return youtube users with certain, unwelcome, political preferences.
Spoiler Alert: Virtually every country spies on other countries.
How is this not top? If our government puts their heads in the sand then theyre just missing out on the info that  everybody else has access to.   Its analogous to not using mint or credit karma because youre scared of hacks. They ALL have your information. You may as well have access too.   Sorry usa, pandoras box is open.
k. whatever you have to tell yourself, kid.
He's just saying all that shit just to get elected and get votes
Okay. I'm glad you have it all figured out. You're right, everything is Americas fault. How could we be so blind?
I feel like everyone forgot the L.A. riots. The reason they happened was because the officers got off light. I'm afraid you are right and history will repeat itself.
Curious that philnotfil makes this all about a report, rather than the overall bullshit right wing anti-Hillary message.
Sounds like idiots who should not be police persons nor be allowed to even possess a firearm. How could it even be true and possible they "forgot" these? Doesn't pass a smell test.
i downvoted because you didn't add to the discussion.
Hahaha, the abuse is proof he deserved it, amazing. Also, lashing out while shackled? With what, his teeth?
Maybe because he claims he is never wrong, and conservatives believe him. But then...they think fox is a legit new source.
The government has access to all of the companies you've mentioned 's databases. And reddit's for that matter.  To deny them access would be a federal offense. To tell anyone you granted them access would be a federal offense.
I am pro choice, but I don't think freedom of religion has much part in the discussion.   The argument that pro-lifers make is that an unborn baby deserves basic human rights.  And the rule about *your* rights, is that they end where another person's begins.   So the discussion is really about at what point a fertilized egg becomes a human being with its own rights.  For instance after a fetus is considered a "person", an abortion would be murdering another person.  But if they are *not* classified as a "person", then they would be a part of the mother's body.   But you can't declare "It's my religion to kill stupid people", then be magically granted the right to kill, just because it's your religion.  Even if they are stupid, they are still people with rights of their own. 
then re-register. you can change it every election cycle. I went from I to D specifically just to vote for him in the primarys and will likely switch again next election to vote for whatever party i want. 
Because it's just vote pandering to the fringes rather than being rational and trying to appeal to a more centrist viewpoint.
I don't think its wrong to meddle in other countries elections.  
.shrug.  That was the thought I had when I saw the headline about Rush Limbaugh, and then read that he was quoting someone else's report, and then read that "A representative with Limbaugh’s radio network didn’t answer an email inquiry." Why would Limbaugh's people respond to a question about a report that they had nothing to do with?  I agree that the Federalist report took a simplistic approach to evaluating the Clinton's foundation and drastically underreported how much of the money that is contributed gets used to do very good work. I was just a little surprised that when Limbaugh identified the source of the claim, that Politifact treated it as a claim from Limbaugh rather than a claim from the Federalist.
History suggests otherwise. If Jeb is like his brother, things will change for the worse. If Hillary is like Bill, things will change for the better somewhat, but the left will nitpick about the things they don't like, even if the lower and middle classes are actually better off. 
Sure as fuck did and i signed up to volunteer
When a defendant commits an act even though he knows his act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to someone else. Like doing doughnuts in a paddy wagon with a shacked, but unseatbelted, detainee in the back.
Yeah, being against torture and illegal wars is just so *stupid*. What a moron /s
I just donated. I actually think he has as hot because he has conviction. Hillary, as with most Dems, is always middling trying to please everyone. On the right, the guys are crazy, but they stick to it their craziness and the public responds to the resoluteness. 
He wasn't wrong in this case, the Federalist really did report those things about Clinton's foundation. The Federalist was wrong about those things, but he accurately conveyed the information provided by the Federalist.
I've got news for you, sunshine:  "Breitbart" and "talking point" aren't magic words that invalidate what a person is saying.  
Well, it's not unusual for them to do that.  I've seen it before.  They are actually addressing the *entire* issue. (if you google it you will find the claim reported in almost every right wing news source)  But it's necessary to limit it to one statement they can "rate", rather than trying to address the overall issue like Snopes might do.  I assume they picked Limbaugh because of the size of his audience.
And this is why the mainstream center on both sides will do everything in their power to squash him.
Why would you post this? This is an ignorant statment, at best, and at worst completely non-applicable to the topic? What do people taking creep shots have to do with the NSA, that is a seperate and unrelated issue? Also, this is ignorant becuase the NSA doesn't care that you ate dominoes and posted on facebook a few times, they care about the patterns that occur over thousands of times that reveal very detailed information about you and your personality. By analyzing your online activity, they could potentially put together a full profile, a map of where you live, your schedule for any given week, where you go to school, what your political ideals are, etc... This if valuable information if say, it becomes illegal to speak out against the NSA it the future, or even more subtly, if the patterns of your behaviour or your personlity makes you a person of interest in a crime that you have nothing to do with. They could use any and all this info to their advantage in so many ways, they could strong arm you into something you dont' want to do with blackmail, they could place you in the vicinity of a crime and try and pin it on you based on your profile, especially if it is a high profile case and aren't likely to catch anyone- they're gonna need a fall guy for PR purposes and dont' think they won't just look for someone to fill that role that  they could prove "could," have done it- not to mention the PR hit you would take personally from that. The examples are too numerous to get into here, but with years of information derived from your internet use, they could basically tell you what you had for breakfast on any particular morning....how can you be ignorant to the danger in that?
I was going to reply to your comment one level up, but I'll so so here to keep the discussion moving.  This discussion is a blow-by-blow seemingly scripted exchange of talking points, and we need to move past that if we're ever going to come to any kind of consensus on the matter. There is a considerable amount of nuance on this subject.  &gt; The problem is when people abuse the system, or use it after they don't need it. But try telling that to the public. You'll get strung up faster than you can say Dukes of Hazard.  I don't think any supporters of welfare programs believe it's OK to abuse the system. That is a straw man argument. There are abuse cases, yes. But how are you going to prevent those without further penalizing the people who need it? Also, what do you mean by "not changing"? What if those people are not abusing the system, but in fact, their break never came and they were never able to lift themselves out of poverty? Who is the government to make that very important, but very elusive decision?  &gt; Corporate welfare  This seems to be a more left-wing talking point, but I do notice that you hand-waved it in your reply. You can't adress people mooching off the government teat without talking about tax breaks and subsidies for corporations.
cant tell if sarcasm or not... he just made statements without providing any sort of context or evidence or support.   its like me saying that any GOP candidate would be the absolute worst candidate for office. they have a 0% chance of winning and i wipe my ass with their stances on issues. what value have i added to the discussion? is there anything in my comment you can refer to when discussing the issue?
Guess what kiddo, this isnt Sweden. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave. The land of opportunity.   Their father does landscaping, the mom owns her own restaurant. Their oldest son is a mechanic and their youngest just joined the Air Force. You think they’re not deserving of what they’ve achieved after being farm workers in a 3rd world country?  My uncle owns a landscaping business and only hires migrant workers. Why? Because they work harder. He tried hiring american born workers when he first bought the business and even payed them more but they’d walk off the job within a day or two because it was too hot for them. I’ve worked with them for snow plowing and they’re the hardest working people ive ever met. 50 year old father of 3 out shovels me at 23 years old. why should someone else take his job just because he came here from another country?  Why the hell should I pay 2x more for milk just to have some spoiled white kid do the same work instead of an immigrant?  This country was founded on immigrants, the more the merrier I say. Let them be legalized so their work can be properly taxed and generate more money for the economy. Theres no point just leaving them out. 
So their ruling doesn't actually dispute his correct claim on the 85/15 split, and hinges completely on simply taking Clinton's word about the money being spent in-house for charity. 
I just donated. Thanks!
I have nothing against radical views. However a president needs to have centrist views so they can attempt to foster bipartisanship. The point of a president is to unify the nation. 
I also used to think redistribution of wealth was a good thing. Now being in the work force, I know the truth. Socialism rewards laziness and statism while capitalism breeds ingenuity and development. Only people supporting Bernie are occupy wall streeters and art majors 
The circlejerk around this guy is really gathering momentum. I hear he saved a puppy from a burning house once. Hilary Clinton started the fire.
Amen!  How cool would it be (not that this would be likely to happen) if they formed a secret alliance to nominate one another for Vice President.  Paul/Sanders, Sanders/Paul.  I'd love it.
It matter if he did something, because Gray did nothing except run from police who would later murder him. 
&gt; Not anti science but the ability to see the truth.  The "truth" that is backed by zero facts or reality-based data.  Sure, nothing anti-science here.
Yet. 
&gt; How will corporations make money if no one can buy their shit?   The robots the middle class built them for automation purposes will be used to trade goods directly between corporations. No need for money at all, just corporate-scale mass bartering.
please don't waste my time if you're just going to cherry pick my comments. my original comment was not an endorsement of the only way i wouldn't downvote a comment.   
That was very brave of you, squirrel! I would donate $50 if it were legal for me as an EU citizen. Any way I can get around it?
So Mark zuckerberg is actually a USA government employee who is charismatic enough to fool the entire world to willingly give up information? Same for the guy who started twitter
yeah but the odds of that happening...
[deleted]
Name one candidate that's never had a number of embarrassing wackjob supporters
Ha ha ha. Horse shit. He wouldn't do fucking anything and he knows it.
"I'm not Romney" was even better.
He'd be 82 at the end of his 2nd term, if he lived that long. I'm not up for age shaming but is it really a good idea to give such a high pressure job to someone of his age? Look at much Obama has aged in the last 7 years. Now imagine that happening to someone who is already really old.
Bernie can't eliminate NSA spying through executive action; you'd have to elect a whole bunch more Bernies to Congress. Just sayin'.
This propaganda is astounding. 
You're right. He shouldn't run. We shouldn't even have elections to determine this. Put names in a hat and let it up to luck to decide. We don't need to inform the public of each candidate's stance and let them decide.
I'm having flashbacks to the way reddit circlejerked over Obama during the last election...   Seriously, does this site never change? 
&gt;You need to give me some guidance on what you consider suitable evidence.   Any evidence at all would be a helpful start. I asked for evidence that they receive less than market value for their labor. You essentially came back with the proposition that we should pay them more than market value for their labor because of various benefits to them and the economy. That's a fine proposition in itself, but it still doesn't show how they are being paid less than market value for their labor. 
Gun control. My major gripe with him. 
And it could very much hurt his credibility and he is going to have to rely on being a  populist canidate to ever have any hope.
Yeah, I'm voting for Hillary.
&gt;I'm just saying have a little faith  and I'm just saying that nothing that has ever happened in recent american political history has given me (or anyone) reason to have faith.   every election there's some candidate where everyone is like "if only everyone votes for this guy, everything will change!" and then no one does, because the general american population are idiots and/or just straight up don't care.  it would be nice, but you're giving way too much credit to "joe six pack" type voters. they're not educated, they're not up on the issues, and if there aren't big money campaigns on tv telling them what to think, then they don't care.   that is the reality facing american politics. it's a lot more than a hurdle.
i get your point about other countries doing it.   &gt; I think if you define crazy in terms of distance from the political center, Paul and Sanders are crazy.  can you please be waaaaaay more specific than that. 
The police report describes it as a "spring assisted, one hand opening knife" which, despite the interpretations of a few journalists - who I'm sure are experts about knives - indicates a switchblade.    We'll see.    It's possible that the police wrongly arrested him on an incorrect interpretation of either the law or the features of the knife he was carrying. If either happened, that's certainly an injustice (as is police taking someone, no matter what they've done or are accused of, on a 'nickel ride').    Fact remains that there's nothing wrong with putting an arrestee in leg irons. 
Oh yes, all 16 of them. Should we dismantle them too? The NSA is in the hot seat at right now just as the CIA was in the past. I wonder how many redditers have even heard of NGA or NRO.
Wasn't that what McCain was running on, too? I don't think that Bush was very popular at that point, even in his own party.
It's insane and ridiculously obvious. There's a handful of members, relevantlife and others, that are obvious propaganda machines.   Political stances aside, the blatant propaganda cause people to be suspicious. 
I don't think anyone sane is advocating for zero abilities for law enforcement to conduct investigations, there just has to be ways to prevent injustice and abuse.
Nuclear power has a ton of problems, the massive and long lasting waste, non renewable energy, the potential for disaster. Of course it looks safe compared to coal but why are we bargaining with which is less deadly to the environment when we can use renewable sources of energy that have practically no negative impact?  Look at fukushima and the government incompetence and cover up of the fallout.
&gt;So their ruling doesn't actually dispute his correct claim on the 85/15 split  That's exactly what they are doing - calling his numbers "mostly false", and they  brought in outside experts to review the tax forms for them to come to that conclusion.  You don't have to trust the Foundation if you don't want to, but it should be noted that the Foundation uses two the the largest and most reputable accounting firms in the country: PriceWaterhouse Coopers and  BKD, llp.  Additionally, for at least the last 5 years (that I can find) they have received a 5 star rating from Charity Navigator.  Navigator has determined that their structure has become too complex to continue to rate.  Their latest tax form is 155 pages long.
Probably paid to do so.

I'm beginning to think that a fairly large percentage of posters in these Sander's threads are actually Republicans, who are desperately trying to drum up Sanders into something that will divide the Democrats and weaken the eventual nominee.
&gt; Not for you, though, right?  &gt;I'm not calling you out.
it's not clear that bernie will either. obama pledged to do plenty of things that he pulled a total 180 on. (and before someone cites republicans in congress, republicans didn't make president obama refuse to call the amernian genocide "genocide" like candidate obama promised to).  people should be weary of a candidate who has lots of sounds bytes but very little in the way of actual legislative accomplishments.
If the government has all your information, and that of your family and friends, the next MLK Jr. wouldn't need to be assassinated. They could politically assassinate or blackmail someone in his family and shut him up. Our nearing dire need for revolution will be taken into a dystopian state if we stamp out internet privacy.
He's an idiot, but that's not what he said. He didn't even mention Obama.  &gt;“Historically, the economy has grown 3.3 percent a year since World War II,” Cruz said. “There are only two four-year periods where growth averaged less than 1 percent: 1978 to 1982, coming out of the Jimmy Carter administration, and 2008 to 2012. Same failed economic policies.”   I like how the author uses "basically" and "literally" interchangeably.  &gt;he basically tried to blame President Obama for the economic crash   Next paragraph  &gt;He’s literally trying to blame President Obama for the crash  The entire article sounds like it was written by an angry 10 year old. Not that I expected actual journalism from forwardprogressives.com
As a staunch democratic Strawman, I want no little girls to ever have a horse or pony.
Yes, that is how he works. He is very good at it, and his audience laps it up.   That doesn't change the fact that the factchecking should have been of the Federalist report rather than of Limbaugh's repeating of the Federalist report.  It isn't a big deal, I just thought it was odd that Politifact would try to get a statement from Limbaugh's network about the report when it wasn't a report by Limbaugh's network.
Until you realize that one of them has a chance of becoming president.
Can you expand on why? 
I'm not thrilled about it, but I think it's inevitable that we're pouring more and more information out there to be viewed by our own volition. Very little of this (or any) information is specifically relevant to any one goal, but a lot of it is relevant to different goals.  In short, *someone* is going to collect our information en masse. The NSA is the wrong way to do it, but if it's going to happen, I'd rather it be the government than private corporations. The government has decent potential applications for it if it's not abused.
No. He's not an isolationalist. That stagnates economies and culture. He's a non interventionalist. He wanted us to stay out of Iraq, Libya, etc, etc. He also wants us to stop shipping jobs overseas. How can I compete with a guy who will do the job for a quarter of minimum wage? Liars call that capitalism. Capitalism didn't prescribe that we send our jobs away, till we have 5,000 rich men, and 100,000 poor men. 
dear canada,  no thanks.
Exactly. I'm not against abortion. That's not my call. Do I hate that it exist? Yes but I'm not subjecting my grievances on others. However, jamming a spike into a crowning babies brain into the spinal cord I do have a problem with. The fact he supports partial birth abortions is appalling in my opinion. The fact he voted for killing a fetus during the act of another crime not counting as a crime itself is also disturbing. Obviously that's my moral standard and not the majority on here. Right and wrong is mostly gray Im afraid. I also hate his standing on economics but that's besides the point. I do like how he is not being bought out and I also like his voting record on gun control. I get the excitement about him if you are a leftist but to say he's "right" is ignorant. To say his views align with mine is much more accurate.
[deleted]
Why do people always forget that Rand Paul is a Tea Partier?  He has almost nothing in common with Sanders.  Their cross section is on privacy and even there they have strong differences.
They can sense evil.
I donated $150 before he declared, but I should probably give more.
good stuff, thanks for the info. definitely let /u/MustacheBattle know about that because i've seen it in multiple threads.
If this were not going to be a term where new bodies were going to be put in for the Supreme court... ahhh then i wouldn't care if he lost. But a republican president next term will pretty much push the country over the ledge and we will more than likely regress into a 3rd world shithole. 
Why do you think only the first primaries matter? 
I don't he'd do well in a debate. He's too old, unkempt, and just a bit crazy-looking. Those kind of optics will not serve him well in a televised debate. 
Who bought all the stuff being built? Government demand stimulated private production which would not otherwise have occurred.
Renewable energy is the future, not nuclear.
We need to have a limited number of terms for prime minister, Harper's been around for too long.
Also totally shutting down the NSA is a pipedream, let alone a bad idea.  Not everything the NSA does Is Literally Hitler, it does have many good uses. Sanders gets love here because he says black and white soundbites which Reddit loves because they have no idea how the real world works, where compromise is the real way things get done.
Whoops!  Looks like people who live in glass houses shouldn't be throwing stones after all.
Lots of people who watched and can clearly remember Chernobyl and Three Mile Island are against nuclear energy, whether their fears are justified or not.
Thank's for the post. I'm poor and I donated. 
"Fun with foreign foundation donors while Secretary of State" crap, too
My father has some working influence on one of the possible contenders.  Their whole shpeel is the reduction, and they hope the elimination, of the income tax (Replacing it with the Fair-Tax), but I keep telling him, "The only way you're guy is going to win the younger vote, is if he comes down hard against the NSA, and other such embracements. 
It wasn't inconsistent, he is very consistent but absolutely short sighted in his policies.
I'm not american, but you guys can't miss this chance. Wish you the best.
This circlejerk is approaching Ron Paul levels.
Which is odd because the NRA helped him get elected (they spent $18000 in 1990 to help him beat Peter Smith for Vermont Rep.) and he voted for a bill that would prevent people from suing gun manufacturers, dealers or distributors for the misuse of their products. He also voted against the landmark Brady Bill, which instituted federal background checks on firearms purchases.
I downvoted this reply because it truly didn't add to the discussion.  My response to "why not" absolutely added to the discussion. I even directly addressed the previous comment's question.
This far before anything happens?  Shit, three other people could pop up for president.  I have absolutely no idea how likely it is and neither does anyone else.    ~~Edit:  Now I have to wonder if I was downvoted because I can't tell the future or because ^ is just pissed that he can't either.~~ [REDACTED]
It kinda does. To get the liberal vote you need to be as liberal nom as possible.  Same will go for the conservative side. When their campaigning stars we will see the same extreme promises but from the other side.
&gt;naivete  and  Getting searched before you board a plain is not equivalent to being fired from a government job or thrown in jail.  Also, I really don't see how Iran or climate change are relevant to domestic surveillance.
Except the billionaire class (;
wow, you have a very strange view of economic history.   no, in fact, the recession started when the Fed, under Carter, raised rates to combat inflation.  You can pretty much track the double-dip recession and the recovery back then by the Fed's interest rate changes.  It wasn't Regan.   And the deficit has actually gone DOWN under Obama from where it was at under GWB's final budget.   Meanwhile, under Regan, the deficit ballooned.  Obama has been far more fiscally "conservative". 
This thread is filled with a bunch of deluded idiots with a short memory. Why the fuck does anyone think this democratic puppet is going to be any different than the last? Do you guys even realize he literally has the same masters as Obama?
Shut up, you broom.
We need to money ball this guy - he will pull everyone towards him with his precise and accurate observations about the US middle class, our failed trade and industrial policy, and the middle class that was thrown out with the Unions Are Bad bath water.  His NE accent and voice are far more appealing than shrilling Hillary - I cannot imagine her voice addressing the nation in any meaningful way, and Obama showed this nation thinks the same. Give us any progressive man that is articulate and expresses our feelings over a moderate woman or a Jesus Saves Conservatives man any day.
Yeah way better energy density than bread, plus the two weeks the bread gives me should be enough time to figure out a way to digest batteries. 
How did I get to r/circlejerk?
In other news, a majority of ducks like water. 
dude this exact same stuff happened with candidate obama but when he became president he couldnt deliver, its like a circlejerk
See, it's thinking like this that prevents anything from ever getting any better. Sure there's people who are just bad individuals, but that number is growing and growing and there are similarities in all of these areas.    Oh just be educated? Too bad schools in these areas get shit for funding, so they end up with shitty teachers and role models.    Oh, just don't join a gang? Think of the bread theif who is only trying to feed their family. People brought up in these areas see poverty all around them except these gang bangers, they seem to have money. 14 years olds don't think very rationally about their surroundings, and it isn't hard to think that being in a gang would appeal to them. Then, once you're in, you're pretty stuck, unless you want to be on every gang member's hit list.    So what can be done to solve the problem? I'm not sure exactly. I think increased funding to public education would do wonders for those neighborhoods. Also, teaching people to trust law enforcement by prosecuting police officers overstepping their bounds.    But no, you just want to throw your hands in the air and say, "it's not my problem". Because the best way to solve a problem is pass moral judgement and then ignore it. It will be a problem to you and I one day.
He only has $1billion - $1.5 million more to go to have a chance!  Don't take that the wrong way. I like Mr. Sanders a lot. I respect him and consider him to be one of the very few decent people in congress, but as well all know, winning a presidential election requires an enormous amount of money.  He will need to raise this amount *everyday* in order to be competitive. 
Democratic Socialism is not compatible with the ideas of classical liberalism that have served the world well.
&gt;What are you basing your statement on?  The fact that the sun goes down, and the wind stops blowing, with alarming frequency. Without a grid scale storage technology, these drawbacks are gamebreakers. How cheap it is under idealized or average conditions is mostly irrelevant, because we don't need average power, we need power 24/7.  Until that exists, we need backup power generation. And we don't want to use fossil fuels. So that means nuclear. And if you're building nuclear to back up the solar and wind, you may as well just run the nuclear plant and skip most of the solar and wind, because nuclear costs pretty much the same whether you run it or not.  You invent grid scale power storage, and I'll jump on solar/wind/hydro(until fusion, which, if it ever comes, will be the endgame for the most part, and we can finally tear out all that massive renewable infrastructure). 
It was the will of the people that Alan Keys no longer hold an elected position. Maybe he thinks that sometimes the will of the people should be dismissed.
That's just naive.
its copypasta from the circlejerk subreddit, but the liberals on reddit are too stupid to realize that they are being mocked, and gild the one mocking them.   LOLOL
good thing there is a subreddit for Sanders. After the initial buzz dies down, hopefully most of it goes over there, which you can elect not to see.
I know, that's why I don't like the fact I actually like a candidate.  But, on the upside, his voting record does back up his words.
&gt; Six Baltimore officers charged in death of Gray, one with murder  This was the title of the linked article. Why should the OP's editorialized title specify "black" man and not make mention of the officers' race(s)? It's usually better not to imply an agenda when a post title is different than the source's.
Dean should have been the candidate.  God damn him not making it pissed me off especially since I couldn't vote in 2004.  Kerry seems to be doing a good job as Sec State but he was an awful Presidential candidate.
Repost text: Automodbot decided to snipe my comment. Well. Fk me, right? Round two: fight!  I wrote an awesome essay on propaganda in another sub. It got shadowdeleted. I guess. Only term I can use.

I appreciate that, but if you want to change the world you have to be realistic. Everyone here loved Ron Paul and we see how much that changed the world, zero, since he didn't get elected.   Unfortunately the USA is always going to be slow moving when it comes to change which is the exact way it has been setup to do, to prevent a king from exerting power over everyone at a whim. Compromise and small changes are the only way things will be changed in the USA, save for replacing the Constitution.
I've heard this one before.
Is it just me or do a lot of these comments seem fake?
Maybe so republicans can't vote in the primaries so that the "worse" candidate wins and vice versa. Just a guess. 
Romney wasn't as close as people think he was. Remember he pretty much lost by a landslide. I donated some money to Bernie, but I am worried that he will split the democratic vote, just like Nader did for Gore. 
&gt; steals years  That's you watching someone get older...  &gt; What a ridiculous term. If you're old, you're old. You can't do anything about it.  It is ridiculous that someone would age-shame, I agree. 
Don't get me wrong, Limbaugh is an asshole and I wouldn't be sad if he OD'd on his illegal prescription pills, but PolitiFact really keeps showing its bias. He was quoting the Federalist and the title reflects Limbaugh and not his source. Additionally this article could have just as easily been written to show that the Clintons are lying about their charitable donations, which is really the big story, but is buried to discredit a discredited man. Limbaugh is right that the Clintons are lying about their Foundation and donations, he is wrong about the amount. But the real story should be the Clinton Foundation missing away millions to provide lavish lifestyles to the connected while the peons try to a little good here and there. Additionally $4.5m on office supplies for their 350 employees works out to nearly $15k per employee, clearly a number that is bullshit.  http://smallbusiness.chron.com/office-expense-vs-supplies-business-5012.html  &gt;Office supplies are commonly defined as small items that are used within the office, such as paper clips, paper, pens, scissors, ink and even business cards.
That's not how SuperPACs work, as they are supposed to be independent. He *can't* actually take money directly from a SuperPAC, and if someone starts one to buy ads supporting him, I don't think there's much he can do. All he can really say is that he won't abuse them by having some of his staff/colleagues/etc go start one. It is my understanding that a wealthy supporter is free to form a SuperPAC and buy ads, regardless of what Sanders thinks of SuperPACs.  People in this very thread are going in that direction already, suggesting that people who can't donate for various reasons buy ads on reddit instead.
Except Ron Paul was a racist homophobe.
Since when has a socialist *ever* dismantled spying?  Be honest with yourself on this one.
You should find out who they are and beat each one of them within an inch of their lives with a bat.
Market is the most efficient mechanism of creating jobs. If you tax them you take that capital out of productive sector and throw into the (wasteful and inefficient) government hands. The old Keynsian paradigm of "demand injection" that you're probably talking about is outdated.
Hahahaha what a fucking joke seriously fuck him, fuck that. I already get 32% of my income taxed and I'm 23. Fuck this meme president. You know what doesn't affect me? My texts being monitored. You know what *does*? Taking away my disposable income. Id vote for another Iraq war if it meant reducing my taxes 
Interesting false lights slander.    ***There is ZERO evidence presented that there were any such dangerous driving techniques done by the officers driving the vehicle.***  You are NOT for justice, are you ...  You want a lynching?  **"Let's get's us some blue uniforms lynched up heah!"**  I despise those who seek to inflame lynch mobs.     
That's cool, his country is also going to go down the toilet once they run out of natural resources. I would just assume everyone that lives in Norway is a bland carbon copy of one another.   I also think it's funny that someone who is the CFO of an Oil company is talking to you about how morally bankrupt "our" rich are, as if rich people in Norway are totally different. 
Thats not the way activism works. There's a reason SJW cemented themselves on highways, its because thats where it would get the most exposure. Get ready for daily Sanders readings on /r/politics, the campaign is here. Edit : Ok then reddit. Maybe he would get more exposure in the great plains /s. FFS
A "lynch mob" is when you aren't given your day in court because someone kills you before that can happen, much like what happened to Freddie Gray.
Going to be honest mate, I have little to no faith in the Greens running the economy and that's a big factor in who I'll vote for.
People like you make me laugh. It's like all logic goes right out the window.  Let me explain how things work.  In the US, hell in most places on this planet there is something called "the presumption of innocence".  Or if you prefer to deal in logic: "the absence of proof does not equal guilt".  When the foundation prepares it's taxes, it's a legal document. Or more precisely, when one of the biggest, most reputable accounting firms in the country signs off on them, it means "we have examined these books and verify this information."  But to you,  Rush Limbaughs claim holds equal weight to this.  It's ridiculous on the face of it.  But that's the nature of political smears. They don't have to be logical or accurate, because there are people who will believe them simply through bias.
It's used for evil?
Happened elsewhere like Ferguson? Like Sanford Florida?  Like LA after Rodney king?  Like Watts in 69?  What a bunch of blow hard bunk.  Always someone elses fault.  No personal accountability allowed.  Guess that would be considered a micro aggression and a triggering offense if we actually held people accountable for their actions.  
You have no excuses for your own murderous intent, for that would be the foreseeable effect of inflaming a mob with rumors like you just have done.   To be clear:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CLAIMS MADE THAT THE DRIVER DROVE CARELESSLY OR RECKLESSLY TO HARM.   The ONLY claim is that the police did not buckle the seat belt, for which there was a new department policy only a few weeks old requiring seat belts to be buckled.      YOU invented the claim of driving dough-nuts at high speed to cause harm.  Given the temper of the mob, that is, in my opinion, incitement to murder -- to stir up the minds of the unstable affected by, swept up in the mob frenzy to go and seek out cops to harm and kill. 
You should be careful what you say. Bernie and Paul have a lot in common and many people opposite of your idealogical view say the same about Sanders. Are they right? I don't think Sanders it batshit insane. I feel the same about Paul.  I was starting to consider this Sanders guy, but comments like this about Ron Paul just show me how immature and small minded Sanders supporters are. If his supporters continue to behave the way you do, I'll be making a pass, if this is the type of human being Sanders attracts he can't be all that good.
I really wish Warren would run.
I am personally a non believer, but I really don't understand the sheer amount of hate that religions get.  Most of the religious people that I know and/or work with are VERY tolerant people and handle loss better than almost any non believers that I know.  If God is their motivation to try to live with love, I can't be against it.  Edit: obviously not all exist this way, but this is the trend I have seen
yeah right
I'm not a troll, being a good candidate doesn't win you the election. Being appealing and having lots of money is what wins.
Thank you. The leg irons aren't the police roleplaying slavemaster, and are common in prisoner transport. 
you forgot the /s
I'm sure he didn't think he'd be killed on the way to the police department ya know?  Which also brings up that point: Running doesn't give you the right to kill somebody.
You really have no idea about anything you are taking about.  http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0NH0TP20150426  As I said, I don't give a fuck what Rush Limbaugh thinks if he OD's on prescription pain killers.  He cited a source, The Federalist, which provided information.  They are the primary source, I'm sure there are many people in the world cited the same source.  At the end of the day, The Federalist holds most blame, but the bigger story isn't about splitting hairs over 15/85% of money going to waste, it's that a shit ton of money is going to waste and the Clinton Foundation is not only lying about that, but they have been lying about their donations for years.  Last I checked everyone knew Rush Limbaugh was a talk radio host who makes exaggerated claims for ratings.  That is all he will ever be.  Hillary Clinton on the hand was a Senator, Secretary of State and is running to be President.  She is the bigger story, not some stoned radio lacky.
Actually the State DS said that it was an unlawful arrest and that what Gray was carrying was legal so :) 
$1.49 million came from Republican strategists.
Hey, if you wanna waste a hell lot on mony on people who are not doing anything for it - I'm right here.
&gt;Luckily Reddit doesn't get to decide anything.  I'm wiling to bet that the vast majority of people here are either not old enough to vote, or simply choose not to vote, anyway.
Charter schools are public schools.  Also, I'm pretty sure that was just New Orleans with the whole "all schools are charter schools" thing.   The Recovery School District, which has schools throughout the state, is a 100% charter district. But I'm almost positive there are districts independent of the RSD that run traditional public schools.
I don't like how the article got the $334 billion figure. It assumes the the full current wealth of the 25 richest Americans will be taxed at 40% if the estate tax is not repealed. That ignores other purposeful or incidental actions by the wealthiest that might reduce the size of their tax break.  Gates for instance is anticipated to greatly reduce his wealth before his death through charity. Other taxable funds might be diverted through tax avoidance strategies prior to death.  This dumb math or unneeded sensationalism.  
It's funny how the right is aligned with the Christians' position and the left is aligned with the Satanists' position. Very appropriate.. I think.
That's fine, you should support a candidate for their views and voting history. Look at what Ron Paul believes  http://www.ontheissues.org/ron_paul.htm  He still believes that abortion is murder. How can someone hold such an unscientific view like that?  "Paper money in unconstitutional; only gold is legal tender."  This man is fucking insane. There isn't enough gold in the world to represent the wealth America has.  "Government is totally unnecessary for gay marriage laws."  Again letting the government step back is allowing discrimination to happen. It didn't work for civil rights in the 60s and 70s and it won't work now.  "Recycling consumes more energy than it saves."  Again what a stupid statement. Recycling is about reusing materials instead of just dumping them, materials are finite.  He is highly pro free trade which is pro big business so he is again just another supporter of the billionaire class.  He is against socialized heathcare which would be a massive step back for America.  "Ideal tax rate is 0%; especially the "inflation tax"."  Oh ok.  Let locals settle Israel-Palestine issue; no world police. "  Locals can't settle the problem, without intervention Israel would just decimate the area.  He is against welfare and social safety nets in general.  You might believe the two are similar in some regards but Ron Paul is very different when you look into the actual issues.

I mean fuck, if billionaires can heavily influence our politics, why can't foreigners?  It really is a bad idea, though.
People don't want to elect someone they always see frowning. Isn't the goal for him to be elected? 
http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=n00005906  wasnt just 'small' donations. funny how a anti-war politician gets directly lobbied from all branches of US military.
Haha, because if America voluntarily neuters its intelligence agencies, other countries like Russia and China will totally dismantle their national security apparatuses too, right?   All this does is hand other countries power over us. It's the stupidest idea yet this election cycle. 
Yeah I'm with you on that.  A lot of users on Reddit tend to fall too easily for the 2-party narrative and have difficulty accepting that it's more of 1-party system.  If there's any way that we can get "fringe" candidates like Paul and Sanders to become standard-bearers for their respective parties then we may actually make some progress towards taking the country back from the oligarchs. 
&gt;  Additionally, for at least the last 5 years (that I can find) they have received a 5 star rating from Charity Navigator ... too complex ...  False, Charity Navigator removed the Clinton Foundation from its website because atypical business model, not because its complex.  I get you want to whitewash the Foundation, but don't spread misinformation.
Enjoy the next year+ on Reddit.
He has no fucking chance against Hilary. Thanks for wasting your time and money. Sanders is a joke.
Yeah it's definitely not happening. It's too bad, because we have more partners than the United States, but they still all manage to suck.

He already had my vote, but he damn sure has it now.
The NSA doesn't do anything the FBI and CIA couldn't do in terms not safety and intelligence.
&gt; Hillary Clinton is polling with some people stupidly high because , "She's a woman."  Umm.... no. It's likely because she's a Democrat with the strongest name recognition out there. In the last 24 hours almost everybody I talked to about Sanders were completely unaware of who he is.  I'm more a Sanders' fan, but please don't try to spread FUD on Clinton. Stick to the issues and track record of Sanders. Talk about him enough and his name recognition goes up.
The math they used to get this figure is beyond absurd.
Welcome to presidential campaigns in the US. They're all massive circlejerks by definition. I'd get used to it.
That's why I'm going to vote for Miss Hillary First Female President, all the "scandals" that surround her are pure fabrications from the media (Reuters, The Guardian, New York Times, etc) and the Republicans. She is clean as water.
Cruz is not a moron. He understands exactly what he says. 
They are paranoid because the US government decided to run a war games scenario that labeled Texas as a hostile state and posted ads on craigslist for common citizens to participate as "rebel" actors in a martial law implementation drill. They said they wanted the drill to be as authentic as possible. Texas is right to at least be a little concerned. 
Parties share policy stances, records, and values, genius. Try passing legislation in a representative government by your lonesome. Politics is about herding cats, not expressing your unique individuality by demanding that your representative matches your every whim exactly. Considering it is a two-party system, figure out which you align closer with and act accordingly.
Are you joking? You must be trolling me. There are opinions and there are facts. Do not confuse the two.
Have you ever been to texas?
It's still not near as much as Ron Paul made, and look what happened to his campaign.  
Steel beams melting. 
You blew it, /r/enoughsandersspam already exists.
You might think they spend their time catching bad guys along with the over surveillance but you'll never finds a report that suggests they are at all successful I that act.
Possibly due to the NSA and via being clandestine operations? Maybe that has just a little bit to do with it?
Buying campaign swag helps. A portion is 'profit' and can be used by the campaign even though the sale was international.   Source: was regional coordinator for Ron Paul, and built a senate campaign from scratch for a minor candidate.
&gt;The country's debt is not the same as personal debt.  You're exactly right.  Personal debt you have to deal with the consequences yourself.  It's a lot easier to use the country's credit, because future generations have to deal with the burden.  It's very selfish and foolish.  &gt; We are borrowing at interest rates that are under inflation, meaning the borrowing creates more wealth.   LOL what planet are you from.  Stop reading Krugman!  Why don't we borrow way more then?  We have the credit line for 50 trillion, so why only 1-2trillion in stimulus? if it will create more wealth.  Please explain this to me.  
&gt; But everything else I can't support out of principle.  Is principle really the problem, or do you think his policies won't work? Let me ask it another way: if you thought Bernie Sanders' policies would improve lives, would you still oppose them out of principle?
Thats not what socialism is. Socialism is the workers owning the means of production. Having democracy in the workplace.   The government seizing private property is not inherent to socialism. And in socialist theory, there is a difference between private property and personal property. The government doesnt come in and take your house, they come in and take your factory. Then allow the factory workers to make decisions themselves.  Also, look up 1930s anarchist Spain. It was very socialist, but there was no government at all. 
I just donated. I've never given political contributions in my life, never thought i would, But i gave 10$. I hope that helps.
Well how many times are you guys gonna post it? Who do *you* work for?   My point is relevant. No one will shut up about this guy on reddit yet he can't even raise as much as a Libertarian (the libertarian party is way bigger than the socialist party). The vocal minority needs to calm down.  I'm probably going to vote for him if he gets the nomination, but I'm not going to ruthlessly suck his dick until it falls off. That's what the leftists did with Obama. 
Sounds like a real Populist leader.
How long did it take for you to write that?  Are you just baiting for replies, or are you expecting to get karma for that?  edit: after looking at your profile, I guess you're just shilling. Hopefully you're not getting paid much, because you're doing a piss-poor job of it.
Dammit Pierce.
I'm not getting paid a damned thing, I'm promoting Bernie because I believe in him.  Feel free to find my first post about him.  
I am going to pop the hype bubble a little bit, and ask...  What would change if Bernie Sanders was president?  The Republicans have shown that they can stonewall pretty much anything Obama wants, and Obama is much more center than Bernie.  There were some big campaign promises given by Obama, that congress pretty much shut down, like ending Guantanamo.    I really want to know, how would Bernie be able to govern more effectively than Obama?  I think he is great, but how is he going to be able to get anything done with congress the way it is?
Well maybe somebody should make /r/moresandersspam for the folks who evidently don't think there's been enough.
"We know" that a massive "fireball from space" is going to destroy the U.S. because of gay marriage. 
How is it being siphoned? Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Someone else gaining wealth doesn't necessarily mean my wealth is decreasing.  So with that in mind, how is the middle class's wealth being ***siphoned*** to the 0.1%?
Im just personally not a socialist. 
I find it hard to believe the wealthy in Norway don't find ways to evade taxes. Of course, the average citizen certainly pays more in taxes in Norway, but a large burden of these taxes fall on the middle class there.  I read an article recently stating that the oil fund produced more revenue last year than the government spent in its entirety. No doubt they are reinvesting that money, but when the oil runs out you can't tell me that's not going to have a devastating impact on that country.  Also, Norway's rich haven't necessarily "allowed" anything. If we are talking about their 1-3% or what have you, they could have voted entirely in their own self interest and still got taxed more as a result of the democratic process.
Haha, this was genuinely hilarious. Without cause, he decides you're a kid. Then when you're much more experienced than he is, he calls you grandpa. The ironic part is that he was questioning your age, and all of his submissions are to video game and TV subs. What a clown. Haha
It is possible to have an intelligence agency that doesn't actively and pervasively spy on its own citizens.
What's the case for the NSA domestic spying program? I'm sure conservatives out there are outraged by Bernie's position. What are they saying? 
&gt; The level of pessimism in the and other threads regarding Mr. Sanders is a little depressing and somewhat ironic.  For me this isn't about pessimism or optimism.   The other candidate is simply COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  She works for the same people and interests that own the Establishment of the Republican party.   Voting for Hillary is voting to fuck yourself if you're not a Wall St banker or a plutocrat.  "Lesser of Two Evils?" Horseshit. Unacceptably bad is UNACCEPTABLY bad.  Picking between the Repub, Hillary, and Sanders is like voting for death by guillotine, or death by firing squad, or life.  FUCK the Hillaristas. Don't let anyone support Hillary.  Make it known either the Dem party makes Sanders the nominee, or we make sure the Repub wins in the general election.  It's either Sanders, or the Repub, Hillaristas. We'll make sure of it.   So support Sanders.  Or else.
Only plot hole I can see is why would God be concerned with how many followers he loses if he starts smiting people? Unless his power is directly tied to how many people worship him. But in that case, he would have really crippled himself when he flooded the whole world and killed everyone but Noah's family. Plus he would have started without any power since God created Man. I've written myself into a hole now.
I agree with most of what Bernie says, but the fact that 2, maybe 3 Supreme Court Justices will step down is terrifying. Terrifying in the fact that Bush, Walker, or Cruz (lolz) could choose the people who determine the legality. For this point alone, I'm voting for HC. 
My only problem with that is we have to dismantle property rights for it to work.
Good call, better go with the one who's no different than the repubs, then.
So it will be the modern equivalent of "god is watching".
It seems that one of these guys was being a stubborn asshole. I think it was Chomsky, but I am not sure. 
Well, it wouldn't if the other cops would call them out. But they don't, so yeah. The whole barrel is tainted.
What good would such a crippled agency do if all it takes to become immune from surveillance is to recruit some local agents with citizenship?
Ok, guy.
Closer, but never getting there, the next president will either be a republican or Clinton, and I don't know which is worse.
Oh hell yeah it is.  The Dem party leadership and Establishment are a pack of completely rotten lying scumbag cheats. They play hardball. So the people had better start playing hardball too.  If you let them shove a corporatist-imperialist candidate like Hillary down your throat, and you still meekly fall in line after that, you know what will happen next time? They'll fucking do it again. Why not, when people like you let them get away with it without any repercussions?   So take a hard line.  Either they give you real, non-corrupt, honest progressives, or you fucking DESTROY their party.

&gt; But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.  That's because modern conservatism is about being an authoritarian.
Sam, you seem petty here. Noam, you're just kind of an ass. 
Banning mags over 10 rounds: Let's start with this and I'll use a story from Lindsay Graham's testimony on the Senate Judiciary Committee. A girl had her house broken into and she grabbed a revolver. The attacker was trying to rape her so she fired every round into the guy. It took all 6 to bring him down. Now what if was two guys? The other guy might continue the attack. What if there were 3 people? What if she missed? She would be out of ammo and her life might have ended. Now Sanders wants to ban mags over ten rounds. 10 rounds might not be enough to save yourself. If I have a 30 round AR-15 I could fend off pretty much anyone. I have a much better chance of survival. Most civilians only have one magazine loaded at a time for defense and generally not in the gun.  Now let's look at the criminal aspects. Criminals will get mags regardless of legality. They already get illegal guns. And having a smaller mag is not an issue for a criminal. They aren't being suddenly attacked and have time to plan and pack extra mags. You know you can switch mags pretty fast and you can tape two ten round mags together for a quick reload effectively giving you 20 rounds. How does banning these magazines help anyone? Why the fuck would a criminal even concern themself when they can buy them illegally.   All the ban did in Colorado is force out Magpul and make people unemployed. I haven't heard of any drop in gun crime. The gangs still have thier old mags.  I have other issues, but I'm mobile and tired of texting. 
Well your anecdotal evidence from late nights in your moms basement certainly raises some questions.  /u/Shamwow22 only saw one commercial at 2AM, so we should assume Ron Paul stole his campaign contributions and used them for ill means.   It sounds kind of absurd when you hear it out loud. 
&gt;As a matter of fact, wealth is a zero sum game.   You're just wrong. Sorry.
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
That happened in Costa Rica and it turned terrible, I don't have much knowledge about Hillary Clinton, but voting just because she's a woman is a horrible idea, if she does win I just hope she isn't as bad as Laura Chinchilla was.
If you live in Ohio, Florida, or another swing state and you vote for Bernie Sanders to take down the Koch bros $$, you're delusional. Like I said, I stand with Bernie's exact position on most issues, but when it comes to 2016, I want a Dem in the WH and 3 left leaning judges to get onto the SC but 2024
But this post is not about any of that. It's about the retarded politicians holding Alabama hostage
Trying to use someone's post history to discredit an argument, that you have no rebuttal to, just makes you look like a douche, even if you're not intending to be.
but which side would elect the Antichrist?  Clearly it would be the right because they actually believe in registering to vote.
So....the claims are bullshit...but Clinton is lying....Just sort of non specifically?  Okay. More "logic" I guess.
Uh maybe I'm old and out of touch, but isn't that pretty much how it already is since everyone has a smartphone and Facebook?
I'm not going to sit here and argue against a claim that can be so easily debunked.   Try using google. 
It's a shame all they consider him is someone who can get Clinton to talk about "liberal" issues. Fuck that puta.  We need a fighter for America left or right.  This is the guy.  
Kind of, yeah. Completely, actually. 
That's fine, but the wider idea of what a meme is, is what they turned Ron Paul into, and further hurt his credibility. And telling an audience of various people to produce memes about him, will get mixed results. 
But Bernie isn't crazy like Ron.  
There aren't riots every day.
You said nothing besides "it's not fair" and still did no explain how it's being ***siphoned*** from the middle class? Yes, being rich helps you be rich. Yes, children of rich have it better (obviously). You still haven't explained how the rich is ***taking*** or ***siphoning*** from anyone.
Well, if it was a spring assisted knife as has been reported, most knife guys (and legal scholars, according to the series in the Voice) would tell you it is decidedly not a switchblade, per the intent of the laws cited. Unfortunately the laws are poorly written and can be stretched by disingenuous LEO's to effect arrests.
According to conventional wisdom on r/politics, everyone except African Americans who voted for Obama, now regret that decision and wouldn't vote for Clinton either and will stay home and vote for none of the above unless Rand Paul gets the GOP nomination. So if Reddit is any indicator, it should be a cakewalk for Sanders.
I think Paul Davis got screwed over because he didn't have the youth vote. Young people just did not vote...
He's got a quite similar ideology to Ron Paul. I guess people are getting over meaningless slogans and trendy campaigning.

Hillary probably gets that much every week.
Pipeline vs. truck, there is no debate. Unless we can teleport it, that's about as safe as it can get.
Mindset has nothing to do with anything. It's just that many people are realists who understand that with the way the system is, there is absolutely no chance of getting anything other than a turd sandwich. Your optimism is admirable, but the reality is that the system will never be changed from within, and the upheaval that will accompany the drastic change that is necessary is not something that most of us will want to experience. Our only real option is to be content with the non-gop candidate assigned to us, and go on about our lives.  Will be nice that Sanders will force Hillary to the left, though.
Looks like we're going to have to re-nationalize a LOT of areas of the U.S. economy and public lands just to restore the social balance that used to exist in the U.S.  Right wing nuts have been allowed to privatize too much of it since 1980 as it stands.  This is what happens when a country allows right wing nuts, self-serving a-holes and the economic "whiz kids" at the University of Chicago to weigh in on any nation's public polcies.  First, they screwed up the Chilean economy in the 1970's.  Now, they've royally screwed the U.S. economy with their privatization over-reach and incompetence.
It's sad to me that someone high up in a progressive society is so willingly engaging in broad generalizations of hundreds of millions of Americans.   "We look at the rest of you as fat religion love McDonald's fans"..."America is too brainwashed by "freedom" to realize this is a good thing."  That guy doesn't sound like somebody who's opinion in these matters should carry a whole lot of weight. He doesn't seem to know very much about the American people despite feeling that he knows what's best for them. I happen to agree with him that Bernie would be a fine choice, but that doesn't sound like someone's who opinion I give much of a shit about with that attitude. 
Wow. Let me get this straight. Your logical way to help further progressive policy is to contribute a couple hundred bucks to the GOP nominee. I wonder why progressives haven't tried this strategy before. 
How can they use that title and claim to have any journalistic integrity? The title of the article linked to as the source of the Rand Paul $750,000 is "Rand Paul closes in on $1 million raised" and other articles cite him as raising just as much as Sanders. http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/09/rand-paul-raises-more-than-1-million-in-one-day/  Not only that, but Ted Cruz has raised even more money. 4 miilion: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/ted-cruz-president-fundraising_n_7075464.html  How can msnbc publish this crap and how come you people eat it up?
Get em Bernie!
He was generalizing an opinion of RoW towards America, don't take things so personally - I'm sure you're in perfect shape.  That doesn't change how other people in the world view our country.  You can like it or not, but it is true.
/r/NeverEnough
The NSA have stopped nothing. They exist for power, nothing more.
I don't see any statistics, so I'm going to stay undecided. I was only taking the transportation into consideration when I commented.  But reading that article is making me think that the anti-pipeline argument is very weak.  The argument is that the tar sands won't be developed unless the pipeline gets made. That's bull shit. Oil could easily raise back to and over $100/barrel. That would make rail/truck transportation worth it, which means the tar sands get developed and all that delicious greenhouse gas gets spewed into the air. Added bonus, even more trucks/trains on the roads doing the transport...  Why not find a way to develop the tar sands in an environmentally safe way? Why not ban the development of the tar sands all-together?   
Watch us elect him.
a strong civic response is necessary to back up the technical solutions that are to follow. If the government is actively moving to undermine secure, publicly audited cryptography, then the job of of building and deploying it is 10 times harder. If the government lays down the law, and declares domestic surveillance illegal, then it's more likely that whistleblowers will come forward and reveal the truth if and when that law is broken.  If the system worked Edward Snowden would have not have needed to do what he did, men of conscience like Mark Klein, Tom Drake and Bill Binney who followed procedure and went through the right channels would be in charge of the NSA, not getting guns pointed at them in the shower and having their lives ruined. Instead the NSA remains stuffed with yes man and pork belly IT contractors drumming up cyberwar bullshit in order to line their pockets.

The title is "Bernie Sanders out-raises Republicans in first day of campaign", which is false.
Stopping terrorists isn't the primary mission of the NSA. Most of the lone wolf type of terrorism we experience aren't necessarily stoppable. The NSA is far better at monitoring institutions like companies and countries. If you think there's no value in tapping the German chancellor's phone, then you don't know anything about how the world works. 
&gt; there are people who feel that taxing is, in and of itself, infringing on people's "rights  That's a matter of opinion. There are just as many people who believe that taxation is necessary. Disagreements can exist within a philosophy without invalidating it. Does that make sense?   
Ron Paul managed to raise 4 million in a single day  http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/paul-supporters-raise-27-in-a-day/
I'm very sympathetic to the Sanders campaign at the moment, but I'm struggling with one thing, and maybe you can provide a decent argument to at least give me the Sanders perspective before I eventually make my decision.  While Hillary Clinton's platform doesn't appeal to me in the same ways that Sanders' does, there's one thing that I know for sure about Clinton, and that's that she can beat a Republican candidate with very high probability, and that she isn't going to do anything completely insane on social issues. A huge worry for me at the moment is that a Republican president could seriously set back progress made on social issues such as gay rights, abortion, etc.  This is not the ideal way to look at things (and it's quite cynical), but I'm currently leaning towards preferring 4 years of stability over voting for the better but riskier candidate. I'm not sure that I'm prepared to risk Sanders vs. Jeb Bush (for instance) when the outcome of Hillary vs. Bush is a lot more predictable. Yeah, he's the better candidate in terms of values, but is he the best candidate in terms of actually getting into office?
I think the point is, abortion is murder, so anti-abortion is anti-murder. Pro-abortion is pro-murder. The reason most sane people are against abortion is because they are against murder. For Satanists to argue their religion is pro-abortion means their religion is pro-murder, and nobody can stomach that. 
&gt;Yes, Clinton signed Gramm's disastrous legislation, with a veto proof Republican Congress.  Check the GOP numbers in the house and senate again.  They weren't close to a veto-proof majority.  Billy C deserves part of the blame.
You mean they tried to remove a tax that only really applied to super rich anyways?
You're right; it should just be limited to US Citizens
No, it's a result of Duverger's Law. Behavior is an effect, not a cause.

Yeah, but if Sanders does win, then he might end up getting assassinated, which I don't think he would be too bothered by it since he's pretty old and the people will know this time who pulled the trigger, thanks to the internet. 
So you think Sanders has a high chance of winning the nomination then? How high do you think it is? 
&gt; The level of pessimism  Correction:  Realism.   &gt; that is the EXACT mindset that allows these turds to keep parading themselves out every 4 years with their billions of dollars.   The "mindset" has nothing to do with it.  The billions of dollars, on the other hand, does.  I get it.  I really do.  I agree with more than a few of Sanders' positions, I agree that Clinton is the "establishment" candidate that comes with a whole lot of baggage, and I really wish it were not down to a contest between who has the most billionaires in their back pocket, but the reality is different from what I wish it was.   On the second Tuesday of November next year, we will be offered a choice between the nominated Democrat, and the nominated Republican.   Slightly less than half the registered voters are going to check the box next to whomever name has the "R" next to it on the ballot.  Slightly less than half are going to check the box marked "D."   As has been the case for a very long time now, the "swing" voters are the most important.  Those people who are registered D or R but will cross the line to vote against their party, and those people who are on neither side and can be swayed.  The best candidate to win those votes is someone who is - like them - middle of the road.  Someone not too left or too right.     Bernie, admirable as he is, is not that guy.    &gt; Just a note...this is the first time in all my years on this planet that I've given money to a candidate and the second time I've volunteered.   That's great, but you have to understand that  the supporters of the candidates you don't want to win (Clinton and all the Republicans, I'm assuming) have a whole bunch of donors and volunteers for whom this is not their first rodeo.  You - with all your optimism - are going up against people who campaign or work on campaigns for a living.  
No he isn't. Our government is just that far behind.   The things he is saying are conversations we should have concluded a long time ago. Im not a democrat, and some people would pejoritively label me a libertarian. Think of me what you will, but even when I disagree with what Sanders proposes, I know he is at least the real deal. That is saying a lot when it comes to politicians. 
You should give half of your paycheck to local food banks to help offset the deficit.  
Well, the way I see it is that I can't think of a price someone would pay someone else to hurt me that is OK, therefore there isn't a price for me to hurt anyone else that is OK.
Foreigner? It's the small brained simple folk like you that got you into this mess.
20 bucks so far! More to come.
Call it what you want; too complex, atypical, whatever.  It's become more than charity navigator can handle.

We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.

My first time donating to a presidential campaign and it's $50 well spent!   Also my first time volunteering for a campaign! :)
&gt;The level of pessimism in the and other threads regarding Mr. Sanders is a little depressing   What pessimism?  I'm not seeing anyone seriously suggesting that he might win. 
So the opinion on the flooding of whole cities is marginal? Like I said, they are both establishment parties, but there is a big enough difference.
Because he makes good money in a society that has adopted a socialism-centric style of living.  Opposite to what many would have you think, it isn't just "poor people" who benefit - everyone does.  Also he has every reason to gloat.  Their education system, healthcare system, retirement system, employment system, and basic quality of life is higher than ours is.  His country also doesn't have school districts closing early due to lack of funds.  But I guess you're right, our system is perfect, that's why everyone LOVES to live here.
&gt; The internet says  If you're on the same Internet as me it should say they *might* not have, but that it's hard to disprove at this time. That's called doubt, and not certainty. It's the opposite of absolute...  They were certainly portrayed to have done so by the Church. Inversion is pretty well known, which was the reason for my Cathars and Gnostics reference.  &gt; Have a nice weekend.  I certainly will.
You could write down all of Rand Paul's policies on a piece of paper... show that paper to the average redditor and tell them this is what Bernie Sanders wants and they would be over the moon delighted 
I am conservative at my core. I think less government is better but it has to make sense. Ever since GW's second term I lost a lot of faith in the Republican Party. I then started voting Libertarian but currently they aren't a viable option. Sanders has a lot of the same things I like against the NSA, pro marijuana legalization, etc. I have a lot of compassion for people and I'm also non-religious. As the Republican Party dug into hardcore religion I just couldn't relate. 
Even if Bernie pulls Hillary further to the left, it doesn't mean shit because there is no guarantee that she would actually act on what she campaigns on if she wins.   
What makes you think he's insane?   I think on every major issue regarding the abuse of power, he was in the right. Not perfect on everything, but solid where it counts. 
Support whoever you like until the primaries.  When it comes to the presidential election we need to rally around the nominee.  Otherwise by not voting or voting for somebody who doesn't have a chance of winning you are mathematically voting for the crazy guy you definitely didn't want to win whether you like it or not.
He believes that we should erode the government's power to protect people so corporations can profit more heavily. 
Norway is not "socialist-centric" whatever the hell that means. Socialism means workers own the means of production in an economy. Norway is a mixed economy like ours, that primarily exports oil. If you look at ANY country exporting oil like Norway does they are doing well enough to tax people high and give them government entitlements. Contrary to what people think, the people on top still benefit more than everyone. A CFO of an oil company in an oil exporting country says his life is good. No... Fucking... Wonder its good.   Our government being shite doesn't mean i should give a shit what some CFO in norway thinks about it. He didn't design his government, and even if he did, and it works well for them, doesn't mean we automatically want it here. If you want Norways model, be prepared to open up drilling and oil exporting in our country too, since that is how they support theirs.  
No  I'd hire someone to represent me, and AS PART of (not instead of, stop building straw men) doing that job I'd expect them to check in with me.  See lobbying means talking to them.   You seem to think there are magic laws that can separate constituents from lobbyists.  Been tried.     The fact you don't think that talking to constituents is part of the job is disturbing to me.   Of course, given how ignorant this whole conversation has been from your side, I'm guessing now the problem is you didn't understand constituent the first time.
You seem to naively think that Sanders is universally loved by everyone on the left, but they're only going with Hillary because they think Sanders can't win.  Sanders is loved by a very, very small number of the furthest left people in the United States. The vast majority of the people are moderates. As I am. I am interested in some progressiveism, but Sanders is a no-go. I really don't like Hillary, but she is definitely preferable to Sanders. And I absolutely hate Sanders' populist rhetoric.  The third option, here, would be finding a progressive that isn't Hillary, but also is much more palatable than Sanders. I would also like someone to run who isn't just a voting record and populist speech maker, but someone who has actually has a record of real leadership in getting things done in Congress. And that man is NOT Sanders. You may like his voting record, but he hasn't actually... well, done anything.  If Sanders by some miracle becomes President, he will be a complete failure a la Obama, because to be successful requires more than just pretty words. You have to be a tough mofo willing to get dirty, and that's not Sanders (and definitely wasn't Obama).
Relevant username.
Are you really voting for her just because she is female? That's like voting for Obama just because he was black and not because you agreed with his policies. 
How about a shaved head and a mike tyson face tattoo?
That's the whole problem. She filed charges that have absolutely no hope of sticking in order to advance her political career. Ironically this is just as illegal as police arresting someone without probable cause.

thats true. But my point is that Rand Paul stands for so much about what reddit claims to stand for but they hate him because hes a republican/libertarian   And they ignore when Obama/Hillary does stuff that they claim to be against.  Matchboxx's point is still valid. People on this website refuse to consider anyone with an R next to their name's viewpoint

Why the hell should be people still be able to be billionaires? There is literally no marginal utility or value in allowing such nonsense.

Not to interrupt here, but it's worth noting that, while this is a popular sentiment on Reddit, it's in contrast with her public stances. However, I'm guessing your not convinced, so lets look at the facts (now backed up with sources!!)!   [Note, I'm only going to be addressing Clinton's positions on "Wall St and the 1%" and related issues in this thread]  * **Campaign Finance Reform** - She calls the current system "[dysfunctional](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/14/hillary-clinton-we-do-have-a-plan-for-campaign-finance-reform/)" and has [called for a constitutional amendment to overturn *Citizen's United*](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/238808-clinton-calls-for-constitutional-amendment-on-campaign).  * **Income Inequality** - [She believes it's a real problem](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-goes-populist) and has made it a [central pillar of her election campaign](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/0324/Why-Hillary-Clinton-is-making-income-inequality-a-theme-of-her-likely-campaign-video).  * **The "1% Issue"** - She recently came out and stated [we need to "topple" the 1%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/hillary-clinton-calls-for_0_n_7108026.html) as part of strengthening the 1% (admittedly ironic because she's a member of it, but it doesn't change the fact that this is her stated position).  * **Wall Street** - She's decided to adopt what I'd call a "gentle Elizabeth Warren" stance on the issue. She's come out and "bemoaned hedge funders paying lower tax rates and called out CEOs for earning outsize paychecks" [among other similar acts](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren-wall-street).   Those are all the "issues" I could think of related to this and her stated positions on them. While you might believe she's not sincere in those beliefs, those are her stated positions on her economic policies. I'm perfectly willing to admit Hillary is "cozy" with Wall Street and there's certainly a fairly intricate web with regards to the Clinton Foundation. However, there has never been anything that has been substantiated (as opposed to conjecture / theory) that would suggest she's "in Wall Streets pocket."  Now, I'm not trying to convince you to support her, in fact, I honestly think it's good that you support Sanders. We need vocal people championing the left at every level of discourse. However, I would merely suggest that the unfounded conjecture in statements like "She serves Wall St and the 1%, not Main St and the 99" is not merited and I hope that if she wins the nomination, you will support her in the general election.  ------------  Despite my username I am not affiliated with the campaign in any fashion; additionally I have neither campaigned for nor donated to her campaign. I am merely hoping that the far left will not abandon her in the general (if she wins) because I see that as the most likely way we lose the general election.  I'm happy to engage in any rational debate based in facts, though, based on recent experience in this sub, I'm no longer going to engage in random namecalling or unsourced wild accusations.
That's exactly what will happen 
No. If there is no mass spam of him, the word will never get to the amount of people needed for him to be elected. 
Good Guy /u/Areal15th, You inspired me to donate $20 to Bernie's campaign. :)
Albert Einstein the committed Socialist and humanitarian, was driven by money!?  Steve Jobs didn't do jack shit, just like Gates.  His accomplishment was his impact on marketing.  Apple products have never been terribly innovative, just good at marketing advances that already exist in some form and charging obscene prices (which marketing and brand loyalty, the latter of which is an irrationality/cognitive bias).  Even the iPhone, the closest thing to a true innovation Apple made, was part of a growing list of candybar style phones and similar to the already released LG Prada (which also had a capacitive screen) but with an admittedly better OS.  But its not like Apple's "but for causation" was that great. If Jobs didn't return to Apple, the world might look different in terms of branding landscape, but in terms of technological development I don't think there would be any FUNCTIONAL difference at ALL.  For some reason, humans like to think of history as the history of great men and not the history of masses of people working silently in the background to create all of these social and technological advances.  The latter is concededly less romantic but far more realistic.
...that isn't an answer. 
So garbage that millions of people donated to his campaign!  At any rate, literally irrelevant to the point. What are you trying to do?
Its' an old diplomatic approach:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes  But let's be realistic here. They have a point, even if it comes with so much irony that you could forge swords out of it. 
Move along. Just a troll.
Even when Obama does something bad it's really for good! It's the perfect way to get things done- he fights for our privacy by spying on everything we do, he fights against war by using drones at a faster rate than the Bush administration and now he's fighting for workers by pushing the TPP! /s
Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same. - Bernie Sanders
The problem we have is not we need more money.. its that we spend too much  I don't know your personal situation but if you paid into social security then you should get it.. I dont think anyone wants to TAKE IT from you.. I think people want to PHASE out the plan or allow people to opt out... if they dont want to be part of it.. why force them? so in 5 years say social security is now OPTIONAL.. everyone who has it..keeps it... everyone else... its now optional... is that fair?  Medicare- again.. I dont think people want to rob you of benefits.. but the system is broken. People like myself would argue you can get better and cheaper care by going free market... but if you're not even willing to listen to our ideas because you're so freaked out we are stealing from you then whats the point?   I dont think billionaires should be given special treatment.. but I also dont think we should be taking 50% of their money..  I don't really see a need for a federal income tax.. I think it's stupid.. but if I HAD to make a federal tax code then Id make the tax code 2 lines on a 3x5 index card...... you pay 7% of your income no matter what. No breaks. No Exceptions.7% for Bill Gates or the Poor family down the block  what is wrong with that ?
I am posting these because I see a ton of similarities between the two candidates. I worked for Ron Paul's campaign in 2012 in IA, and at first glance, there are a lot of similarities with both candidates.   * Many small donations supporting the campaign, and people highlighting that this is a good thing. Ron Paul's top donations came from people in the military and most were small amounts. Online donations and "Money Bombs" fueling campaigns  * Seen as "extreme" (too "socialist v. too "libertarian" for their party. Discarded as "cooky" or "impossible to win" or "Longshot"  * Going up "Against the System" An outsider from the machine.  * Tons of online and youth support.  * Ideologically consistent, does not pander  The policies aren't all exactly the same (some are, like NSA dismantling and foreign policy), but it seems to me that Sanders is the Ron Paul of 2016. What I mean by this is that the media will do its best to get people to forget about him, BUT he will shift the conversation of the whole party in the correct direction. [Let us not forget John Stewart's piece on Ron Paul.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtDJ6Ay4QMw&amp;spfreload=10)  I could see myself voting for him, and I'll have to do research to see if my state has a primary I can participate in as a registered Republican.
I love how this is now something Hillary is running on. Undoing her husband's mistake lol 
I have such a raging hardon for this guy. 
&gt; The best candidate to win those votes is someone who is - like them - middle of the road. Someone not too left or too right.  I'd argue that because of Bernie's voting record in the Senate as well as his time as Mayor of Burlington, he can show voters that he truly cares about their best interests, despite being to the left. That the "left" doesn't matter as much to a voter so long as the solutions coming from the "left" will be, or if Bernie can show them they will be, in the swing voters best interest. I realize though that if Bernie gets the nom, Fox News is going to be blasting the word "socialist" around even more so than they have with Obama. But Bernie embraces the Democratic-Socialist label. Additionally, those swing voters would assumedly call themselves "moderates" or "independents" which Bernie also has that credibility since he is an Independent in the Senate.   Those swing voters are going to be middle-class and working poor. Given the current approval ratings of Congress, I'd say that those swing voters, if being questioned by a poll, would say that they are tired of establishment politicians and believe that most politicians are not looking out for their interests, but the interests of corporations.   Now, I could be wrong and I acknowledge that this is all purely speculation, but to me this seems as though it could be a strong possibility during the upcoming campaign season. 
Everybody knows who he is and he's still not going to win.  *edit - Instead of downvoting how about you guys tell me why he* ***will*** *win.*
The powers that be are going to cream Bernie.  just wait till all the  , 'he's a whacko' stories start filtering thru the media...

This article disheartens me. Reminds me of all the time and effort my friends and I in college worked on the Ron Paul campaign only to see it go to waste in competing with big corporations and their billion dollar donations. 
No, Bernie Sanders actually makes sense.
He knows how to pander to demographics really well.  Politicians have done this since forever.
What are his issues anyway?
Yeah I wonder why America didn't want an out of touch loon who used to run a racist magazine as President. Had to be the billionaires. 
I don't care, for the first time we've got a guy who's truly fighting for us. Now it's my duty to do everything I can to get him there. I'm not giving up just because the road looks too tough to climb. 
Trust me, if a magazine that published racist articles is the worst crime you can pin on the guy, that's fine. I understand focusing on his politics is much harder to critique. 
If I didn't live in a state that will 100% vote republican without exception, I would spend time. But since it would be a wasted effort, they'll just have to take my money and use it in states that it will actually matter.
or, at least half.
Ron Paul. Tough vote, but it was there.
Why is wanting minority representation seen as an illegitimate reason to vote for someone? I want to see a woman in the white house. That is a huge deal. It was also a big deal to elect a black president...twice*. There is not a "wrong" reason to vote for someone.   *Not to mention over 90% of black people consistently vote Democrat anyway
Who cares about surveillance? What are you hiding? Just stop uploading stupid shit on the internet. Everybody should already know that anything that you upload becomes public for everyone. Also don't say stupid shit over the phone and you should be golden. 
I can't stand Ron Paul. 
She also sat on the board of directors for Wal-Mart. I don't have a lot of respect for someone who sits silently as her company squashes the attempts of the workers to organize, then calls herself a Democrat for the people.
What's disheartening is that someone would liken Ron Paul to Bernie Sanders. The two could not be more different economically - so, without expressing some kind of radical change in their own ideology, it makes me suspect that these people are either myopic politically and/or always on the hunt for a cult of personality.
TIL.   Good job.
Apparently you have a hard time reading. Its ok though, I guess we can chalk it up to a poor public education system. 
Which particular figure?  The point is look at how much taxes are collected with respect to GDP.  During the 90% tax rates on the upper income rates; collections didn't change much from what they are now.  You can change the policy quite drastically but tax receipts remain pretty consistent.  The wealthy don't get W2s.  They own assets and can wait to sell them off.
the south.
Flat tax is fine if they keep the standard deduction and make it bigger.  Something like everyone gets the first $50K tax free, and then everyone pays 30% after that.  It would simplify the hell out of a way-to-complicated tax system filled with loopholes all over the place.
Good on Bernie for making a big deal about not breaking campaign finance law! We should praise him for being exactly like every other presidential candidate since it is illegal to coordinate with SuperPACs as a candidate. 
Sick burn bro. Go Manny!
Yup, $1.5m is chump change. I don't know why this is news at all. 
I agree with all of your points except one. Most of the "elected" officials aren't actually elected. They are considered "safe" to their position and not worried about being unseated.
This doesn't count the Koch money though, does it?  D:
Obama says they are not doing this, so this is a lie. http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-says-there-no-spying-americans
Ron Paul broke fund raising records the last election.  Of course, he won his parties nomination.....  Oh wait...
Go and kiss some 1% ass then. This reflects more people want a chance, not more people have lots of money. . 
Hey remember that time when candidates raising shit loads of money was something to be sneered at?

What *Republican* Chief Justice John Roberts  said....  &gt;"Politicians are expected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences of their supporters.

"Politicians are expected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences of their supporters **who have the most money and power**. Indeed, such 'responsiveness is key to the very concept of self-governance through **bought and paid for** elected officials.'” 
Well, he is Canadian.
If your not going to tell us, just give us link and stop trying to sell the guy like he's a used car.  
Funny how it's bitch and moan about how we need to balance the budget right up until they make it a priority to give money back to the wealthiest families in America.  Apparently that money doesn't count.  
I can't stand his kid either.  unfortunately the majority of voters in my state were clueless enough to vote for this "libertarian" douchebag.
You can decrease it with the right regulations though! 
He will get no media attention, and if another person steps up he will get no air time during debates 
ugh he would be so much better than clinton. she's ultimately backed by huge corporations, whereas people like howard dean who are actually passionate about what they want to do (like education reform), send their kids to public school, doesn't have the lifestyle of people in the 1% while pretending to care/understand without ever doing anything about it. bernie is mad cool, I interned for him once.   prob biased because I live in vermont but w/e
have you ever heard of google dude
[deleted]
Hah, I thought the same. Sounded too politically generic for something from Sanders. 
Detroit shows us what could happen if Democrats win in 2016.  Oh wait...
shut up and spoon feed us!
Ironically, I won't give money to Bernie because, like him, I don't believe candidates should have to pay their way into national politics.
But but but but money in politics!!!
If you want the economy to grow, the wealth needs to spread. As collectivist as it sounds, the economy will not grow if the wealth is in concentrated hands.
I was referring to the free trade agreements and his opposition to shipping jobs overseas. He is for the middle class and more jobs here in America means a stronger middle class.
*the Republicans.   FTFY
By that standard you also eliminate 35 to 40 jobs on average per project once the project is finished.
Keep talking Bernie to me baby..
Yeah, I've heard waaaay too much about how awesome Bernie Sanders is in the past 3 days.   Something is beyond fishy.  EDIT: 3 mins ago I was +3, nope, nothing out of the ordinary here!
Because it's day one. 
no he is not friggen crazy and does not  just makes shit up 
Yes, but most candidates "follow" the law by "not" co-ordinating with the Super PAC set up to support them, *wink wink*, because co-ordinating with them openly would be illegal. I mean they'd be caught. I mean, the appearance of legality is fairly seriously maintained. 
[The same way Obama did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTn9gC_rerQ)
Right, her massive funding from financial institutuons is just good old fashioned democratic ideals in action.
This is shy the housing bubble was created.  Easy loans and easy down payments gave wayyyyy to many people the ability to buy homes.  When hundreds of thousands of people defaulted.  The whole fucking world went down with it because the us real estate market is a 25.7 trillion dollar market.
If you are dumb enough to fall for Sanders bullshit, you are hopeless.
Are you referring to Sanders or Paul? Because this could be said of both of them.
Please win..... Please
You mean he doesn't want to win. Period. 
Because he has been lauded as "unelectable" yet in day one he raised more money than his republican counterparts. The PEOPLE want Bernie, the average donation was $45 and I'm proud to say I put in double that. Let's keep it up and get the man the funds he needs to win this.
Would a socialist say that?
People are excited to see all his supporters because the media keeps saying he doesn't have a shot. He does, and this is a decent indication if that. 
Yes, right now he is getting coverage but watch what happens when another big name comes to try to get the democratic nomination. The news will forget all about him and focus on the bigger named politician.  The people don't decide the media does. He maybe popular on the Internet but is he popular with the media.
Not a conflict of interest. 
No, he doesn't. Sanders is an elderly, uncharismatic, white, Jewish, self-proclaimed socialist. Pretty much the *only* thing he has going for him is support from the far-left youth- a demographic with such an abysmal voting record, that it is arguably the least important voting demographic in the country. The biggest youth turn-out for a presidential election was in 2008 at 51%, still significantly below the average for other dems... And that was when a cool, charismatic, young black guy was running.   FiveThiryEight, one of the most reputable and accurate election forecasters in the country, has literally said "he doesn't have a shot". He polls 57 points behind Clinton nationally, which is a monumental gap that will be nearly impossible to even half-way close. Having a bunch of your fringe supporters donate to your campaign the first day doesn't change that. And, let's be honest- yeah, he out raised what other Republicans raised on their first days, but it's not like it was by a massive amount. Paul raised just over $1 million and Cruz raised just under that.  It's not like there is some monumental movement to get Sanders elected- just a very loyal and very dedicated small following that will probably get him through Iowa and New Hampshire and then fade into non-existence come March.
Give it a month.  He's going to be cast as this cycle's "crazy uncle."  Every cycle has one.
You realize the CU ruling said nothing about political donations to candidates or parties right?
30 year old checking in (fine ... 31 in a few days)  I remember watching Bernie talk over the last few years and thinking "It's too bad we could never have a POTUS like this."  Then when I heard he might run I though "Oh good.  He'll keep Hillary honest in the debates." thinking he wouldn't be a serious candidate because he can be downright "weird" at times.  Seeing how many people threw their support behind him in a few days is really making me think he might have a shot.  I haven't been this hopeful about politics in since the first Obama campaign.  I have to admit Obama has been a disappointment.  I think Bernie might be enough of an intellectual pit bull to make things happen instead of just getting everyone's hopes up this time around.  **I've already started donating to see what happens.  Remember guys convincing a friend to match your $10 donation is better than donating $50.**
when the smoke (and mirrors) clears, we'll probably find, just as we did with the last Democratic Party Messiah, that [the lion's share of those donations came from wall street and not main street.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/barack-obama/obama-campaign-financed-large-donors-too/) (edit - add link)   Bernie's there to give the illusion of "choice" where there is none.   The Democratic Party's "Super delegates" will be choosing that party's presidential candidate, not the lowly plebs. "Democracy" is much too important to let you little peons interfere with the process when the ward heelers and party bosses have so much at stake in terms of pork and political appointments.  
&gt;So downvote and move on?   &gt;If most people on this sub are upvoting Sanders related content, it might be reflective of what the ~~readers~~ upvote bots like.   
 Sure, but without the kookiness. 
Pity those cops didn't give Freddie Gray that same courtesy. Or Mike Brown, or Tamir Rice, or Eric Garner, or John Crawford III, or Walter Scott, or Eric Harris, or...
The hype in 2008 was so strong that it reached all the way to the Brandenburger Tor in Berlin. And it wasn't just dumb americans who swallowed the hype. Euro-peons were drooling all over themselves to see [George W. Obama](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/07/berl-j26.html) and listen to his prevarications and lies as though it were gospel.   
Well, he seems very representative of those who sent him to congress. In that he is an absolute drooling moron.
I hope he can somehow pull off a win in the primary. There's no chance he wins the general election against a republican. He's waaayyyy too far left and all the moderate voters will go for the republican because it's less extreme. I know Reddit loves him but he honestly has no chance in battleground states in the general election.  Edit: Bernie Sanders in the general election would be the best case scenario for republicans.
Ron wasn't all that bad, but Rand is in no way the same guy.  
No, you are very wrong. Ron Paul was an extremist in his party just like Bernie is for the Democrats. There are going to be a lot of parallels and it's foolish of you to dismiss them based on your own bias. The fact that you can use the word socialist when describing him is going to cause a lot of problems for him with the average American.
At this point it's ABC for me.  Anyone But Clinton
People are going to day the same thing about Bernie.
The issue here is that it puts democrats who don't support Citizens United between a rock and a hard place....either you buck the new system of campaign finance and do not win or you give in and join the ranks of republicans, palms-open for billionaires to hand you their bribes and exert influence on policies. There's no way around it, either you stick to your principles and lose or you do what you have to in order to win. So a democrat is either a loser that won't take bribes or a winner who will, and may or may not ignore the donors later once in office.  Pretending that they are all the same however is incredibly naive. 
I think you are both wrong, and need hobbies.
You use the weapons you have.
He's radically in favor of abortion and gun control, he favors immigration, he'd probablly want to expand every entitlement program. He voted to slop lots more gravy on the stimulus package, he wants to essentially nationalize colleges(aka highschool pt.2)which is way too expensive and will probablly devalue whichever degree I get and make sure I need graduate education.  And that's just from what I know about him, he's sort of an unknown value as I don't know what tricks are up the sleeve for a socialist   Also in the end, me and my family will probablly never benefit or qualify for any government program while we do take a hosing from taxes every year. So I wonder if he's really in my best interest.
I think he is expecting Hillary to make a pit stop at his show one more time before he leaves the show.
He doesn't have a chance because rhe media won't give it to him. Every media outlet is saying he doesn't, which makes it a self fulfilling prophecy. Fuck those guys.
One, such behavior is pointless and unnecessary. Two, what you should have said is that you disagree with him, not call him names, we are adults here. Three, a lot of people are going to label Bernie as a fringe candidate just like Ron Paul, you would do well do pay attention to such things.
That $4 trillion is merely the up front cost. America will be paying for these wars for decades in the form of medical care for vets. The legacy costs will ultimately be much higher.
I can't even believe this drivel was published.  It's an obvious attempt to obfuscate with the intent of marginalizing an entire ideological group by focusing on the "inaction" of those individuals the author identifies.    As a conservative, I can say without equivocation that these sorts of police-related incidents make my blood boil...**BUT** I prefer to reserve judgement on an incident until the facts are known.  Rushing to indict people on a single event - based on evidence of *past* abuses - is intellectually dishonest, inflames tensions, and is counter-productive.
Minimal government is ideal.
&gt; hillary clinton is corrupt to high fuck, we can even smell that putrid stench from across the atlantic.  Thank you, this literally made me laugh out loud.  Not sure because of the phrasing or because it's true.
Youthful optimism is cute, but I've seen this process happen to many times to have any faith that anything will be any different than it always is.
That didn't exactly cost anything though.  The Federal Reserve is kind of disconnected from the rest of the government.  Either way though, the boys at the Fed are the good guys.  
thats not right. Campaign law is far more restrictive today than at any point in our history, especially after McCain-Feingold. Keep in mind that the FEC is only a few decades old.   As for this being a GOP thing, keep in mind that Obama's superpac out raised Romney by tens of millions of dollars, and even in the 2014 GOP wave election, democrats outraised Republicans.  It's ok to protest current law, but important to remember that both parties do this.
Not really. I mean it would be pretty fucked up if I could vote for him.
You falsely claimed CU established precedent. Also, those statistics are not even necessarily linked to CU. Just because they are thrown in an article about CU doesn't mean that CU was the cause.
Sweet! Let's keep it rollin' Bernie.
The thing that Imo makes him a serious long shot is his openly socialist stances and background. Repubs fucking hate socialism even if they don't know what it means. And he'd need to appeal to the right to get elected.  Otherwise the Repubs will come out in droves to vote against him.  Same with Hillary,  Republicans hate her. Probably more than Obama. The Democratic base is disenfranchised and the right is on that tea party momentum. I think huntsman should get the Republican nomination, because I'd vote for him as a staunch liberal. Have a good 4 years, calm the climate then let Elizabeth Warren go get elected and mop up the country with finance reform. 
You absolutely should. Like I told Asmatic below, Sanders brings some good stuff to the table that Clinton will be forced to address. I'm not saying you shouldn't vote for Sanders or help with his campaign, I'm saying you shouldn't go around saying that he has a realistic shot of winning the presidency or blaming his low poll numbers on "the media" or whatever scapegoat you want to use, when the reality is he's just not a statistically good candidate. 
Sure, just like his mom - lives in poverty, struggles to feed her kids, black, sees her son admiring drug dealers and street gangs, knows her son has an extremely high chance of going to jail and/or dying before she does..  Just like growing up in one of the wealthiest areas in Houston. 
I was just being snarky.  No offense meant. 
He's a fringe candidate who isn't batshit crazy.
Thanks buddy, I like you too. :)

Elected in landslides in '10 and '14. They are doing the people's business*  * "The people" being the 12% of eligible voters that actually voted for the GOP
But hey, at least those pipelines are coming online. /s
OK, that's fine. I'm just saying be precise about what the candidate you support said so you don't end up upset later. That's it.   Hillary is for the NSA. If she gets elected and a meteor came down and destroyed the NSA utterly, would that mean she broke a promise? No of course not. 
But, FREEDOM!  Right, guys?  FREedoh...
&gt; Have they really?  Yes. If you don't know that, you weren't paying attention in the 90s when working conditions improved, and the lower and middle classes saw significant improvement in the quality of life they were experiencing.   &gt; Or is that the appearance they wish to give off?   Both.   &gt; There's plenty of times the Clintons have pushed an agenda that has hurt average Americans.  But on net they did more to help America than hurt it. Shit, if Gore had actually been seated after the Clintons, the US would so much better now too. 
Why would they say any different?   He doesn't have a chance of winning, so why would anyone report/comment any differently?  If Sanders if the most potent opposition that Hillary is going to have, this race is done before it even started.   A Sanders nomination would be a dream for the Republicans.   While I'd love to see a Paul/Sanders general election, but it isn't going to happen.
That's your personal opinion.
&gt;The Supreme Court held in Citizens United that it was unconstitutional to ban free speech through the limitation of independent communications by corporations, associations, and unions,[21] **i.e. that corporations and labor unions may spend their own money to support or oppose political candidates** through independent communications like television advertisements  You realize the CU ruling explicitly addresses political donations to political candidates, right?  &gt;"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech."  
As a neutral - he comes off condescending and you come off smug so you are both right. 
This topic has been flagged as not being about Bernie Sanders but is on the front page. prepare for immediate deletion. 
More campaign money that way. Where do you think most of the money in politics goes? Commercials cost money.
The amount of people calling Ron Paul crazy in this thread is ridiculous. He has a greater grasp on economics than almost any person alive today.
Biden But others will come out to set themselves for the future. But Biden will run knowing he will lose to Hillary 
Yea.. that's what I'm worried about :(  Trying to figure out a way to beat them at their own game.
You don't think the billionaires that own them care??
can't rely on traditional modes of advertising/reporting as heavily. heck I doubt if he's on the debate stage he'll even get equal air time, I've seen some nominees get completely ignored in questioning while others ramble on about nonsense. it's all a sham, driven by money. when the public gets sick and tired of it, they will finally get out and vote
Another reason for the media to hate on Sanders is his position against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A lot of the big media outlets for some reason don't [report it all](http://mediamatters.org/research/2014/02/05/study-media-leave-viewers-in-the-dark-about-tra/197932) since many are heavily involved (lobbying for the TPP, etc).
But it fit in Dick Cheney's back pocket sooo much better. 
You know what assuming does?

If only 1% or 2% of police officers are bad cops, and the other 98% or 99% aren't exposing them and getting rid of them, then maybe it's okay to be critical of the majority. 
[deleted]
What in the world did you say? 
Dude, sorry, Ron Paul **is** a crazy idiot.  He completely rejects separation of church and state; he still wants to destroy the UN; his economic plan involves eliminating five cabinet-level agencies (including Education &amp; Energy) and all foreign aid; etc. etc.
I know. "He's crazy, he wants to take us back to the gold standard" is a talking point memorized by people who have close to zero understanding of monetary policy or its history.  And the irony is, this is exactly what Democrats are going to do to Bernie. Just desserts I guess...
He didn't say that its ok.  All he did was say that it's legal.  That's what a judge is supposed to do.  Not interpret then laws to how they think they should be, but to interpret them how they were written, and uphold them despite any person opinions.  He wasn't a fan of ACA, yet he upheld that law because despite his personal feelings, he did not find it unconstitutional.  If you want federal campaign finance reform, amend the Constitution.
Thank you Mr CFO from Norway!
It's a good thing it isn't ultimately up to the media!  He can win if we vote for him.
My initial reaction is "he'd get nothing done". Then on second thought, no president is going to accomplish much unless the hyperpartisan atmosphere in the country changes. So if that's the case, I don't think this should be held against him as at least he'd be pulling in the right direction. 
And the GOP wants to increase Pentagon spending this year...
&gt; It makes ample sense to people who know what a metaphor is.  no it doesn't. it didn't make any sense on any level. you were full of shit and now trying to hid it.  &gt; lol The problem with liberals is they know so much that simply isn't so.  sorry, you're thinking of conservatives. consistently the most misinformed group of voters on contentious issues.  you can look up the stats for yourself. income growth for the bottom 20% in particular flat lined during the oil crisis and Reagan made sure it never recovered and instead all the growth went to the top.  &gt; First?  the timing is irrelevant.  &gt;Maybe you should've asked me first what I consider what social rot is instead of pretending to be a mind reader.  really? you're going to invalidate every one of my items because of a single one you didn't  think should have been included but which doesn't effect the clear evidence of the others in any way shape or form.  that's pretty sad.  &gt; I see, so the rampant inequality we see now is because our liberal policies aren't liberal enough!  ya... you might want to get your head out of your ass and look around at the world. US policies are some of the most conservative around in the developed world, and the US has the greatest amount of inequality... inequality that has increased the most under the last 3 republican presidents.  &gt; I think you have your cause and effect reversed.  ya... no.  &gt; The Black Belt, and now the Brown Belt. Failed liberal policies.  so fail liberal policies... in the deep south? you have completely lost the plot.  but i already knew that. you're here basically still arguing for trickle down economics when we've had 8 years of that under bush 2 and had the WORST job growth since ww2 even if you EXCLUDE the recession. but you still think conservative policies are a great idea. unbelievable.
That is not how the math works even a little bit. Jesus.
He's not _supposed_ to have a chance. Just like Ron Paul last time, the more successful he is at gaining grass roots support, the more the media will marginalize and ignore him. It's the way they keep up the status quo. I can't believe people don't see this yet.
Except his proposed budget for the 2012 campaign used the same trickle down economics that has shown to be a failure to balance the budget while proposing to eliminate entire departments of the government and decrease money going to social safety nets like Medicaid/CHIP and unemployment insurance to offset the tax revenue decrease. Ron Paul in 2012 wanted to eliminate the estate and gift taxes, eliminate capital gains and dividends taxes, and lower the corporate income tax. If you think he's this brilliant economic genius then you're wrong.   Edit: downvote all you want but I saved his budget figures in a spreadsheet if they're not on his website still.
There are about 95,000 miles of coastline in the USA by one method and 12,000 by another (depends I think whether you count all the curls and twists or not).  About 1/3 to 1/2 are in Alaska.  That still leaves a ton of coastline.  The USA is huge, land is not the issue.  Yes, coastline in Lond Island or West Palm is expensive, most other places it isn't really all that bad.  Not billions that is for sure.  Yes, and we had one civilian power accident in all the years of nuclear power in the USA.  So all those insurance premiums over all those years.  You get to billions pretty quickly.  And the more power plants you have the less each insurance premium becomes.  That is the idea of insurance, when you pool the risk over a larger group it goes down.  That is the primary argument of Obamacare anyway, or do you think that idea is bad as well?
If you review my history, you'll see that I've spent years in politics. I've seen how superpacs work up close. I've had all the briefings on FEC regulations. I know the difference between the c3 and c4 world, and all the legal trappings that go with.  What I hear from you here, and sorry is this is harsh, is "I read something on the Internet and now I'm an expert." You are a person with an opinion and Google.   The inescapable fact here is both parties are accountable to the same law, monitored by a split FEC board that whose members would love to claim a scalp of the other side. The other inescapable fact is that Democrats constantly outraise Republicans and that has been true for the past 4 cycles.  That doesn't make Republicans innocent. But it does make you just another loud voice on the Internet.
Couldn't agree more.  I remember reading somewhere about the dollar value of media exposure. The idea is that, say, a 5-minute interview on Meet the Press is worth $X million in advertising. When you look at numbers like that you realize just how heavily the media's hand tilts the playing field. A snubbed candidate might have to spend millions of dollars to grab a 30 second commercial slots in between another candidate's interview, which they pay nothing for.  That of course is before you get into the media talking negatively about your candidate.  This is a big part of the reason why libertarians aren't interested in campaign finance reform. We look at 2008 and 2012 and laugh at the idea that stricter campaign finance rules would have done much of anything to give Ron Paul a fair shot (though they would have knocked the Adelson-backed Newt Gingrich out earlier in 2012, which may have helped us). That's not the reason our democracy is dysfunctional. In fact, our only hope right now might be an honest billionaire stepping in to sponsor an honest candidate.
I think we should pool all of our incomes and distribute the funds according to need.
I'll match it next month then.
It's not useless. The vp has a role in the house, as well as various minor roles in the executive branch. Not to mention if something should befall sanders warren would become president.   Edit: VP is president of the senate not the house. 
I'm not a Ron Paul or Rand Paul fan, but this is still an interesting from the perspective of a politician's image.  There's a filter on who the American people can vote for, and seeing these dramatic changes in Rand Paul's stance over the last 6 years does make more sense.
Imagine a presidential debate run by Redditors???
Yeah... That's interesting isn't it. There was a much better illustration of this recently that was more like a cloud showing how people in our Senate and House voted on issues, where you can see the clouds moving apart. I couldn't find it though.
Fuck the media.  Telling people that seems to work for Republicans, why not liberals?  My god, when will people realize that the media in this country is long-gone, and begin to think for themselves.  I know, I'm dreaming.
That is a gross misrepresentation of what a new aumf would do. We already have an aumf in place from after 9-11 that has been used to cover the war against ISIL as a successor organization to AQAP. The problem, for dems anyway, is that the existing AUMF has no sunset provisions and includes a very broad authorization.
I disagree. Political contributions from unions are no different than corporations and billionaires contribute to both parties en masse. https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php  The middle/lower class has no voice in either party until the money goes away.   
Something wrong about what I said?

Agreed, and good job, patriot.

His family wont suffer the financial hardships. He will. He is an adult. He did something bad, and now he is being punished for it. If he didn't want to face the consequences he should not have rioted. 
Why? You can easily google it.  "Hillary is terrific," she said when asked again if she would endorse her in the event Clinton makes a run for the Democratic nomination.  I'm not sure why Reddit thinks that Hillary is so conservative. She doesn't say she will do conservative things. And her record does not show her doing conservative things.  On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, and Coburn ranks 101. Hillary is FAR from a Republican. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate  EDIT: Just reread my original comment. I should have said, Warren supports Clinton AND Sanders.
More like only maybe 50 million. 4 years of college is that expensive. But, fewer than 50 million Americans than that have been to college since 9/11/2001 though so I'd estimate that would effectively just be making college free. 
I was confused about that too, though I think the GOP base believes Obama has vetoed a lot.  That being said, in a lot of the talking points I've heard, it goes hand in hand with the Harry Reid talking point in that if Reid had called votes for the bills the House had passed, it would have made the Dems look bad because either a) the Dem-controlled Senate wouldn't have passed them or b) if they had, Obama would have vetoed them.
Or he just shouldn't have turned himself in. He obviously was just pressured by his stepdad to do it. If he wasn't he learned his lesson. No need to take the high road if its going to ruin your life.
I haven't voted on any of your posts, fyi. Notice how you're below 0? that's not from me.
What is this crap. Bernie Sanders is not the first nor only Progressive in the history of the United States.     First off, I love Bernie Sanders and support him in his run for President, but these articles are really getting ridiculous. A simple search on their past records shows that BOTH Clinton and Sanders are progressive, with Sanders being MORE progressive than Clinton. That doesn't mean that Sanders owns all progressive ideology.    On the liberal to conservative scale, Hillary ranks 11. Bernie Sanders ranks 1, and Coburn ranks 101. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/31/1374629/-Hillary-Clinton-Was-the-11th-Most-Liberal-Member-of-the-Senate    
I knew it was one of them. I wanted to say senate at first but I doubted myself. My AP government teacher would be ashamed. 
Lemme guess,  under 25, white,  suburbs?
Banking acts passed after 9/11 makes it illegal.  It doesn't punish the recipient, but it will freeze and seize the contributions.  In theory, a multinational corporation, not declared a terrorist organization, received money in such a way that the money could not be "directly" tied to a declared terrorist organization, could use that money for US candidates.  Drug cartels not on the terrorist watchlist have no problems posed by this.
So, crimes should only be punishable if they don't create financial hardships?  Kudos to the parents.  Make your children responsible for their actions.  Teach them that actions, good and bad, have consequences. 
&gt;So then who should a middle class person support?  Well, at the last presidential election, people favoured Obama's policies to help middle-income earners over Romney's [by a 10% margin](http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/22/news/economy/middle-class-election/). So I guess a lot of people know something you don't, or at least aren't frothing adherants to a debunked ideology.

Here's an interesting [article]( https://revolutionaryds.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/why-pundits-are-wrong-about-hillary-clintons-inevitable-victory-over-bernie-sanders/) from /u/revolutionaryds
Modding adds value. Day Z is a prime example selling hundreds of thousands of copies of Arma 2 years after its release. Mods drive sales of games. Its an identifiable benefit. Left4Dead was nothing but a mod till Valve picked up Turtle Bay Studios and released the game for full price.  Modding typically can change the entire setting simply using a games engine. A mod can be a completely new work intellectually.  But people working for free to drive sales of large capitalist organizations is something gamers arnt just ok with but actively pushing for.  You all insured independent game assets can only be made for free for entitled douche bags and a life of bullshit retail or food services is the best they can hope for.  Because you need free titty mods in Skyrim.
Justice in the US depends more on your social class than what you have done.  For the crime of damaging a police car, the son of a poor man will spend months in jail before his day in court.  The son of a rich man will be out on bail. When that day in court arrives the poor kid will take the offer, plead guilty to a felony and be released for time served.  The rich kid's lawyer will get the charge reduced to a misdemeanor. Punishment will be a fine and a few hours of community service.    The next time either of them appear in court, the poor kid will be a felon with at least one strike.  The rich kid will not have that problem.
How about he shouldn't have rioted. That would have solved all his problems. There were peaceful protests. He could have shown his support without violence. If someone trashed your house, and they were never found you would want them to turn themselves in right? You probably would not have the same sympathy if it was your property.
Then I'm an idiot.  deleting previous comment.  Thanks for setting me straight.
Or, even better, paid off some of the national debt  Every year, year after year, the government spends a large chunk of its income paying interest on the ever-expanding national debt  Remember when we had a budget surplus? I will NEVER forgive the republicans for squandering it on unnecessary wars  The republicans claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility. This is the counter-example that conclusively proves them wrong
The mainstream Democrat and Republican candidates would never go for it so the media wouldn't cover it.
Hahahaha
Why? Because i am not siding with a person who helped destroy a city.
wow you really have it all figured out haven't you? How many BuzzFeed articles did you have to read to come to such wisdom? If there is one person missing from our political discussion, it's a guy in his early 20s who smokes pot and posts to /r/adviceanimals    Also, **this is a copy-pasta from two years ago**: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ylpy9/dear_gop_are_you_fucking_kidding_me/
With our debt, I think we're technically the world's poorest country.  EDIT: Well excuse the fuck out of me for daring to imply we should be more fiscally responsible.  Keep raising that national debt and see how it works out for us.  Seriously, our country is like a college kid with a wallet full of credit cards.
Bernie supporters should go the Ron Paul route and replicate his delegate strategy at the Convention.    There was a ton of fear in the Romney camp about it.  Edit: thanks for the gold!!
Like I said you support the molesting of children. Thanks for clarifying.
America is just one big fuck-up-machine.

Nah, her talents are too great for such a menial office. How about Senate Majority Leader? 
Yes :(
War Sands 2016
They once had that when debates were sponsored by the League of Women Voters.  That was unacceptable to the media conglomerates, so the League got cut out by the media conglomerates and the candidates.   Its not going back to the old ways.
Yeah and the Taliban and the Baath party would continue to violate basic human rights, like education and freedom to worship whom/whatever they want, or the more pertinent right to life.. But those Afghanis and Iraqis aren't US citizens so they're not entitled to those same human rights.
But but FREEDOM!!
Heh yea, technology has made things pretty easy for us these days. Liquid Democracy is kind of magic :D
Because a non viable fetus isn't a person, legally or in reality. Duh.
I'm not sure /r/politics would be able to formulate cogent questions for republicans.  It would just be a string of hate filled rants littered with grammatical errors and spittle.   Bernie Sanders would be forced to answer the same question over and over again.  "Bernie, why are you so wonderfully wonderful?"
That is certainly interesting and I certainly hope Sanders is able to win, however I think he will need to come a long way in both polling support and fundraising before the media starts calling him anything but a longshot.
I'm not even American but Ron Paul is the only political I ever really liked. 
go look at other countries that are doing that so called stealing and see how friggen great their economies are doing ...  go.... shoo go look   hint: i like norway go look there .. there are other countries to learn from also ... 
Sanders-Warren 2016!
Can't wait to read it! subscribed :D
Yeah,  because neither of those countries enshrine theocratic principles in their new,  "free" constitutions. Try being a Muslim on Afghanistan and leaving the faith,  then tell me how that freedom's working out. 
And this is why a Republican should never again occupy the White House.
And universal healthcare is a shining example of fiscal responsibility.

No. Not okay. I disagree. Youre just going to have to live with that. 
I don't think he is, but it distorts popular opinion in the same way, just probably in the opposite direction.
Realclearpolitics.com  Imagine...... a story like this from a rightwing website.  Meanwhile several polls from actual neutral news organizations have her winning against an unnamed "Republican" candidate.
That would mean Sanders winning the primary, so.... nil.  edit: I'm going to vote for him, but let's be realistic folks.
Except Ron Paul is a race baiting pos.
I'd argue that you discount the science of "human psychology.  All these rich media types depend upon it for Jedi Mind Tricks^(tm) to get you to vote their way.  Its not easy or common to be an informed individual with critical thinking skills.
So were just really stupid? And broke
&gt; Probably makes more sense to make college free  Making college free would just lower the quality of college, and lower the benefit of having a college degree.   We need LESS people going to college - not more. 
Don't worry, republican politicians can't tell the difference between brown people from Mexico and brown people from Syria 
The same effect is true of any government subsidy given to a private industry with no strings attached. The industry simply raises prices to match the subsidy and pockets it.  The only way around this phenomenon (that I know of) is to nationalize said industry so that the government can directly control how the money is spent. This opens up a whole new can of worms, but has probed useful sometimes for certain projects that benefit all of society, such as k-12 schools and building and maintaining roads.  I don't imagine a system where nationalized home building is going to make anyone happy, though; in fact housing projects have had a pretty horrible track record in both the US and the USSR.  I think that one of the best (and least corruptible) solutions to help people afford homes or rent would be to take that hypothetical $4 trillion and use it to increase the [standard deduction](http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc551.html); it's the one tax break that can benefit almost anyone, and it has the most benefit for low-income people.
Scary isn't it. Congress just loves to kick the can down the road, and every president, even our current president, completely support it. For some reason the topic is bad luck to bring up during campaigns as well, since any politician that runs to fight the national debt end up losing.
W. Bush ran on a platform of dismantling the department of education.  When he left office not only was the department of education still around.  We got no child left behind and homeland security.  Republicans love them some big government.  
If? It's already happening.   I'm Canadian so I can't vote for Sanders, although I do think he's by far the best candidate that I've seen. However, the idea of Reddit officially or unofficially sponsoring a political candidate makes me a bit uneasy, and I imagine others feel the way.
Predicting the randomness of a ball getting into the net isn't in the same realm of probability as predicting the outcome of an election.  Even average people get this, as evidenced by two common phrases:  "It's the playoffs, anything can happen."  "Our politics are so predictable.  It's always a choice between the lesser of two evils."
EW for VP! 
A drunk idiot repeating "nuh-uh" in defense of their soup sandwich.  Shoo. 
Thanks a lot, Liz.  This is like if your cheating wife won't screw you, but she offers to buy you a hooker. 
Well, if you look at Warren and Clinton's voting records and positions they are very similar on most issues.   Yes Clinton has raised a lot of money from Wall Street, but so will any eventual nominee for the R or D in the general election. Obama started his campaign saying he wouldn't accept those big donations, but changed his tune once he realized he needed them to win.  EDITED to better answer your question.
[deleted]

If Obama was half of what Reddit claimed he was in 2008 and 2012, Reddit would be calling for Obama's 3rd term.
True. I recall hearing saying "Obama is a socialist and a communist" when he was running. That's why we need to educate people as much as possible.
It wasn't nearly as bad as the sanders spam is now.   edit: Just look what happens when you even mention sanders in bad light. There will be no discussion, you must vote Sanders. Ignorance is strength. 
Fuck the GOP. 
romney was an idiot, huntsman would have been a better candidate imo but he wouldn't win the primaries - republican voters amaze me sometimes.   but you're saying obama doesn't have the uber rich support? didn't he continue the bush corporate bailouts, didn't he continue spending billions on the wars(aka industrial military complex), didn't the wealth of the uber rich increase under his first term? democrats and republicans may act like they are different from one another, but there aren't many differences btwn what they actually do imo  I voted gary johnson in the last election, did the uber rich allow him on the debate stage? no, even though you would think a libertarian would be popular among the rich, he wouldn't have kissed their a** by letting BS legislation through so he got ignored 
That's still a horrible Idea. 
I think that's a straw man argument. They never said everyone should "go home and kill ourselves." They were just being kind of dickish and saying Sanders won't win the presidency.
And being marginalized into Ron Paul territory would be the worst thing for Sanders.
Do those condos come with fighter jet air patrols, missile defense shields, mortar-proof domes, and other security measures? Can we ride bomb-proof busses to and from work, and have our workplaces protected as well?   Look, I realize the wars were unpopular, but 9/11 did actually happen, regardless of the fact that 50% of the people complaining about the subsequent wars were only about 5 years old at the time.  The Afghanistan war was fully justified -- Afghanistan was a stronghold for bin Laden, and allowing him to recruit more would've been pretty stupid. Iraq is still debatable.  Edit: LOL well, kicked off a real clusterfuck with this one. Here's some clarification since I've had my fair share of downvotes and don't want to wait 5 minutes to reply every time:  1. I never said the wars weren't mismanaged. They were. Funding things is usually a fuckup as far as our nation is concerned due lobbyists from Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and a host of other military industrial complex companies. It's gonna happen regardless of who is president, which is why, even with Community Organizer Obama at the helm, the debt still grew.   2. I agree Iraq was a stupid idea; however, the notion that "most people the night before the war started" were against it is absolute bullshit. Everyone but the people who knew for sure (Saddam, weapons inspectors, inside people basically) believed Bush and his cabinet when they said Saddam was harboring terrorists and WMD.   3. Afghanistan was a necessary war, along with the encompassing war on terrorism for the most part, and yes, until Obama decided to pull out of everything and allow the vacuum that Bush and everyone predicted, I felt we (the US) were safer. With the rise of ISIS in that vacuum and the SJWs here who sympathize with them, I feel slightly less so now.
Bernie is a socialist/progressive. That appeals to the younger selfish kids, and liberals, that want him to steal from their neighbors, so they can have an easier life.  Basically, Bernie will buy the election by promising to rob more from the taxpayers.
There's a distinct difference between upholding cultural standards through a piece of paper and through a sword.
Two east coast liberals running a left wing ticket in a national election?  What could possibly go wrong!?  Seriously though, he needs to build support with Democrats in the West and or South that he can campaign with and having a vp from there helps.  Someone slightly more main stream and progressive but younger. 
War profiteers are the scum of the earth.  I don't want a dime of my money going to them.
That's a completely different situation though. Clinton and Obama are both relatively moderate democrats. Sanders is a socialist, which to many people in the US basically makes him a communist. 
Is banning violent video games conservative or liberal? 
[deleted]
Uh huh, you mean like the death penalty they can sentence you to for apostasy in Afghanistan? 
No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying Gate's tax burden is anticipated to be less than the article claimed due to donating his assets to his foundation. 
Stop reading the bullshit media and follow his posts
This right here. And it's important to note that the growth of that debt, after expanding due to the recession, is now starting to level off and is showing a trend of potential reversal. Our biggest problem in regards to recovery is the majority of the growth has been in service sector/ restaurant work (with almost 4 million people averaging only $21,000/yr). Investments in education and infrastructure always have a positive return on investment. It's time we invest in ourselves and our posterity.   It just so happens there's a candidate who has a platform to address these issues, and has been fighting for it for 30 years.   http://www.sanders.senate.gov/agenda/  If you'd like to learn more or just have questions come visit us at /r/SandersForPresident. Everybody is welcome. 
Compared to the hyper inflation in the housing market that the Fed and Bush administration did with flooding the building market with near zero interest rates that was one of the main underlying causes of the financial collapse of 2008? 
Unfortunately, media or no, the vast majority of humans are not in the business of thinking for themselves. 
This. This This this.
Just when I thought I'd heard the most disingenuous thing ever, he had to keep talking.
Since conservatism means keeping the status quo and conservatives are usually for small government, and banning violent video games would be a big-government reform, it would be liberal. Plenty of conservative grannies would back it though.
Hate to burst the "look at the idiot who doesn't understand how Congress works" talking point here, but he's clearly talking about the Republicans in general and last I checked they do indeed control both houses. Members of the two houses in fact communicate with each other.  Also, regardless of what Mitch McConnell has said and in spite of Lorretta Lynch's confirmation this week (which was very high profile nominee), there will be dozens &amp; dozens of confirmations coming before the senate over the next 20 months that could still get held up.  Gosar could have actually tipped the GOP's hand and instead of snickering at him the Dems should be holding McConnell's feet to the fire about his pledge. 
How old you were when 9/11 occurred could sway your opinion. The punched-in-gut feeling everyone had watching it burn, people jumping, then the collapse itself was sickening.   That said, just so I understand your position, what is your suggestion on how we should've responded in the aftermath? Leave them alone? Pretend nothing happened? Try to understand, apologize, pander, and beg their forgiveness?
In my mind, we've never done anything right regarding Iran, and if there was any country justified in wanting nukes, it would be Iran.     They haven't started a war in over century.  They were taken advantage of with early deals to buy their oil fields.  Then when they tried to fix it, we had their government overthrown by a brutal dictator.  And when they finally overthrew our asshole we put into power, America supported Iraq in an invasion of Iran with loans, satellite imagery, and materials to build banned chemical weapons. We then blocked Iranian pleas to the UN to sanction Iraq for using chemical weapons.    Up to 100,000 people have died in Iran due to those chemical weapons.   That's more than the number of Americans that died in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Gulf War, Vietnam, and Korea combined.   Every year America is threatening to invade Iran with Israel, for damn near 30 years now.  No wonder they want nukes!  The nuke is the greatest deterrent to war in all of history.  We let fucking Pakistan have a nuke, and North Korea, but not Iran...  Iran is the kid we bullied from 1st grade to 10th, and now we're starting to get a little worried he's going to bring a gun to school.  
People in the U.S. are only relatively poor compared to the wealthiest Americans. Every poor person in this country has access to subsidized food, housing, and electronic telecommunications devices. Honest question, should we be paying for people to have access to what most people in the world consider luxuries?  I would also point out that part of invading Afghanistan was to remove/destabilize an organization that had publicly expressed the desire to continue attacks against the United States. Should we just allow that to continue?   I do believe that part of our invasion of the middle east was to secure our energy interests as a country. I have some qualms about this but I feel like we have to protect our interests, and I feel by and large we'd rather trade with foreign countries than fight them.   I'm a fairly socially liberal guy, but I'm hawkish on foreign policy because ultimately I think that until we solve the scarcity problem, it's us or them. And I don't want it to be me.
Breitbart: your "go to" site for doctored videos.
Non-voters certain bare part of the blame, although I'll give a pass to anyone that was disenfranchised during the numerous voter-roll purges and intimidations that take place on a regular basis in red states.
Very insightful. 
Probably because they view these police actions as legitimate. 
Or maybe you're just wrong and people are letting you know.
Here's what annoys me, and maybe I'm just irritable in my old age. Reddit is filled with know-it-alls with no experience and it grinds on me.  No one questions that Republicans agree with the majority of the Supreme Court -- that donations to political causes is protected under the 1st Amendment.   So who is more honest here? Republicans who admit they take donations and defend why they do it... or Democrats who take donations while blasting Republicans for... taking donations? Give me a break. People aren't dumb, y'know?  btw. I can't say I insulted you. You'd know it if I did. After years in politics, I hear people like you all the time. You get *just* enough stuff on the internet to make this quasi-coherent point, and kind of excitedly go "see! see!!! My guy is GOOD. The other guy is BAD!!!!" We jokingly call that the opiate of the asses.   I spent many years trying to get people like you to recite the arguments I wrote, as a political staffer, verbatim. And while you don't know it, that's exactly what you're doing. Hell I could probably name the 3 Democratic staffers behind your terrible point and tell you drinking stories about each of them.  When you see Congress up close, you learn both parties have their good citizens and both parties have their criminals. Both have their A-students and both have their short bus. So when you try to present me this stark dichotomy of "Republicans bad!" I can't roll my eyes hard enough -- and I'd do the same if you said "Democrats bad!"  Honestly, what can you throw at me that's going to make me think "geez, this random guy on the internet and his Google search sure makes me second guess years and years of experience!"
I'm starting to believe Warren might really not run for president, and it's baffling to me.  She obviously has ambition, she's repeatedly taken the kinds of stances that create a clear message (like a presidential candidate needs to do), and she's gotten nothing but favorable press.  It's not like she can easily wait.  She's in her 60s right now.  If she assumes Clinton wins, she can't run again for another 8 years, by which time she will be in her 70s, creating issues for her campaign.  And so much can happen between now and then to reduce her popularity.  She would never have as big a positive push as she does right now.  I really just don't get it.  I wonder how late is officially too late to start a campaign.
&gt; How is Bernie supposed to have any chance at all when the media has already told most Americans he has no chance of winning?   By not having the policies he's supported for the last 20 years.  He's the most liberal Democrat in office, which means he appeals to the edge of the party.  He's not polling well within the liberal half of the country, so he's definitely not going to win when you throw in the conservative half.  &gt;And why do we allow them to pass this off as a fair system..?  How is it not fair?  
Elizabeth Warren will be 75 in 10 years.
Exactly!! I remember when Paul got second in one of the early primaries, and the media play him off as a novelty. Major /r/wtf there.  Don't worry, we will use technology this cycle to show them what's what :D
Conservatives can only fake rage about issues that don't affect them or issues nobody else cares about!
except Obama is actually a right leaning democrat. Sanders is way further left than Obama has ever been as President 
I didn't say Democrats call Obama a communist.  Sanders is running as a Democrat, so I doubt Democrats are going to start calling him a communist.
Well - remind them that 8-9 years ago the MSM said the same thing about Obama vs Hillary. Obama had no chance of winning and Hillary would be the DEM candidate. They were wrong then too. 
Agreed, except that I'm doubtful about "turned into". I suspect that American culture was much more authoritarian and I know it was much more racist in the past. Conservatism is the part that hasn't changed as much.  The thing about authoritarians is that they believe all sorts of stuff that doesn't make sense, according to the research. Facts and arguments are not necessarily going to change their minds. But they are highly conformist, so if the rest of society clearly changes, they will eventually go along.
Defense IS a primary purpose of government while housing is not.  Plus, let's be realistic.  It would have gone to billion dollar companies as subsidies.
&gt;Well, if you look at Warren and Clinton's voting records and positions they are very similar on most issues.  They are similar on pretty basic social issues like abortion, but that is true of essentially every Democrat.  Here are just some of the ways in which they're different:  http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-vs-elizabeth-warren-big-differences-despite-claims-contrary-1640810  &gt;Yes Clinton has raised a lot of money from Wall Street, but so will any eventual nominee for the R or D in the general election.  Not necessarily, if Bernie's campaign lights up the internet and spreads enough via word-of-mouth.
Have you ever seen that episode of the Simpsons where Homer gets an amazing job in the utopian city, but his boss is a bond villain. [Or how about the porchmonkeys scene in Clerks 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZoVcfUhcZ0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m43s) It's similar to the problem here (though the Simpsons only uses the boss a side joke).   Conservatives tend to only see the good side of civil servants; they always seem to be nice to them. It's out of the realm of possibilities that these pillars of the communities could be so cruel. When conservatives see that one of these paragons of justice shot someone, the immediate reaction is 'that person must have done something do deserve this'. 
Fingers crossed.
Sanders has no chance. I assume his candidacy is for publicity purposes, and possibly to try to induce Clinton to make some commitments during primaries to be a little more to the left.  It's not just the two-party system. In a national election you have to be near the median voter to have a chance to win; Sanders is too far to the left. Selecting him in the primaries would also mean passing on a historic opportunity to elect a female president instead of an old white guy.
Not a problem; 95% of people missed the point of my posting this, which is a little saddening considering what I thought was an ideologically neutral post still stirred the Bernie Reddit hoard. I just want people to know that this kind of political character on the Republican side was in the last two elections in terms of how he was funded, excited fervent base, and had different ideas than the rest of the republican party. The party shit on him, and media ignored him even when he was winning straw polls.   Idk whats gonna happen, and Bernie will be the most exciting Democrat in the race by far, but I don't expect corporate media to be fair to him at all. I am hoping that young Democrats will see how much the game is rigged after this election since all the young Republicans already know it.
This is idiotic logic and not at all in tune with where the country is. "candidate A says kill all puppies, candidate B says lets not kill any puppies. CLEARLY the winning platform is to kill half the puppies!"  NO. Go away.
this is a longer reply, read it or don't read it.    What really amazes me is how little the average American understands about taxes.  You pay on your check  Social security tax Med tax State tax Fed tax City tax (in some places)  Social and Med are played by any one with a job, and the best part? As an employee you only pay 50% of what you are supposed to pay, the government makes the employer pay the other 50%.  Unless your a doctor or a lawyer, salesman whatever.  Then you front the entire 100%, and you pay the most taxes of any group bc by def of tax code you are self employed.   State tax is minimal and states like Wyoming, Vermont, and a few others don't have income tax at state level. City tax is dependent like state, some cities tax you for living and working in them, most don't though.  That just leaves Federal tax which is what the argument is about.  What's hard to understand is if you make less then certain amounts then most likely you get everything you paid back, and if you make $25,000 or less and have kids then you have a negative tax rate, meaning you get more then you paid back.  So it's not about what is fair share, fair is that everyone pays the same percent.  Not the same amount. And so is it fair that just bc you worked hard and have money you don't deserve to keep it?  9/10 business fail in 5 years.  Of the surviving 1, 3/5 will fail in 10 years, so out of 50 business only 2 will be around in 11 years, and you don't think that risk and effort should be awarded?  Trump fail and fail to get where he is, Mark Cuban sold trash bags door to door for years to save money to start a business.  Bill gates' "Traf-o-Data" failed miserably.   When someone told me that 9/10 business' fail, I didn't think "o I can't do it, the odds are against me", what I thought was "you mean if I fail 9 times I am promised success?!"  I can fail that many times if it means that I can own my own business and never work for any one else again.  
It hasn't been true in awhile, but I remember we dared to go to the moon just 5 decades after setting flight in a rickety wooden plane. I remember a time when we graduated the most people in the entire world. I remember a time when all Americans shared in the highest standard of living the world has ever known.   "The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the government."  -FDR  Accept the mantle of greatness bestowed upon you by generations past who had to fight and shed blood and die to gift you the things you have taken for granted. Let's take control of this ship. 
That's why I generally don't vote. 
are you american?
I'll be on the edge of my seat! Thanks or understand the post of me posting this! Most didn't.
That's a truly positive sentiment and it actually made me feel better, for now at least. Thanks.
It doesn't matter. If he wins the Democratic Primary, he will scare moderates into voting for the Republican candidate in the general election.
It's already happening in this subreddit. They should just rename it to r/sandersforpresident.
Thank you. We have a long history of greatness in this country, it's about time we embrace it. If you haven't already I recommend you read Howard Zinn's: A Peoples History of the United States.   http://www.thegoyslife.com/Documents/Books/A%20People%27s%20History%20of%20the%20United%20States-%20Howard%20Zinn.pdf  If you'd like to contribute ideas for changing the world or just have some questions, come visit us at /r/SandersForPresident. Everybody is welcome. 
Would you rather see a hundred carefully crafted ads on TV for various candidates, or see a bunch of comments from grassroots supporters of Sanders?

I knew Ron Paul was a jerk. Didn't know he was a circle.
True assault rifles are capable of burst/automatic fire, but the assault rifles the media talks about are semi auto Ar15's. So most politicians that talk about getting rid of assault rifles are saying they want to get rid of a semiauto gun because it looks scary.
I agree. But his views on foreign policy didn't end at pulling the troops home.  I think Obama has done a fantastic job, one he doesn't get enough credit for. Ron Paul's take on the whole thing would have been to send everyone home and stick our heads in the sand.
The power of talk radio, fox news and etc.  They can sell talking bass.  They can sell anything to a certain number of people.  This is a great article:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/  Here's a chart showing how "Red" wins the majority of districts even though 60% of voters are "Blue"  http://i.imgur.com/QBfXwUq.png  **IF GERRYMANDERING WASN'T EFFECTIVE THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING IT.**
Semi-Auto rifles are NOT assault rifles.  What annoys me is when they propose to ban AR-15s and such.  Leave it alone and get rid of the illegal guns and impose federal background checks.
Flat tax is a terrible idea. It HUGELY massively unfairly impacts the poor. 
You're far too naive if you think a subreddit like this and the content in it isn't manipulated to convey a certain message.
What do you think it takes to change the world? 
Why are you pretending like income tax is the only kind of tax? Are you so unimaginative that you cant think of any *possible* alternative?

Okay, well for people who do both, I'd much rather see comments then sit through  the same 30 seconds of bullshit when watching TV.
So all jobs should be blue collar manual labor jobs?  That is what you want to do with your life? Yet the current administration and those from the Democratic Party along with Bernie Sanders want to make college "free" and it seems their focus is on higher education.  Are the people of the future going to college to learn how to build bridges and such?  Do the colleges today have majors in steam shovel and caterpillar skills? And those jobs have a lot of layoff time involved Depending on your employer's ability to get contacts and winter work.   &gt;Most of the jobs that are left Americans will not do for less then minimum wage.  What jobs are the ones that pay less than minimum wage? Don't strippers make good tips and there seem to be plenty of girls who do that.   I don't know but I've seen money hanging from them on some T.V. series. 
Exactly. How did the country ever run without the IRS? Everyone knows the IRS has existed ever since the founding of the country.
I know semi automatic fire a lot slow but still why do regular people need burst fire like that? I had one pro gun guy tell me they need i for pig overpopulation in the south. But i feel there has to be better ways of controlling those than fireing wildly into a group of pigs
But why do you need a semi automatic rifle for honestly?
Hey, I don't make up the rules. This is basic political strategy. I'm just helping answer OP's question. 
&gt; Sites like Reddit are the new media  this is terrifying. there's zero depth here.   also, young people don't vote, so unless you have a message that resonates with the people who do, it's all for naught. 
Didn't mean you were complacent, just voicing my concern about a problem that will continue to plague in our political system.  I applaud your service, and your commitment to something you believe in. It will make my generation (millennial) and future ones that much greater, and we truly thank you.
Is he really a socialist though?  I know he's talked about worker owned cooperatives but that is still a far cry from complete control of the means of production.  He seems to push for something similar to what many northern european countries have instead of outright socialism.
&gt;(think about it: nearly $100 million raised from grassroots; a pro-life ob-gyn doctor; an anti-Obamacare DOCTOR; married to the same woman for 50+ years; universally viewed as honest; huge crossover appeal with independents; polled better against Obama in 2012 than any other candidate; predicted the financial crash; unquestioned fiscal conservative credentials; a war veteran (amidst a stage of chickenhawks); any other Republican candidate with those credentials would be a shoo-in)      OP neglects that RP wanted to eliminate the department of education, energy, commerce, HHS, FEMA, etc. I couldn't take the guy seriously either.      I wouldn't want any of those Ron Paul supporters to make an online effort to get BS elected, other than simply donating to his campaign. They drove that man's name into the ground, and assaulting people with their opinion of him. There was a sub dedicated to ending RP spam from his reddit fans. They didn't add to his credibility, they detracted from it.

&gt;It hasn't been true in awhile,  It was never true.  The only reason the U.S. is the power that it is is because all the OTHER leading economic powers spent the first half of the 20th century knocking the shit out of each other, not because of any particular quality of americans.  The moon shot was a play for international prestige, and vast amounts of that work was pioneered by Germans.  &gt;who had to fight and shed blood and die to gift you the things you have to for granted.  I'm sorry,  they didn't die to "gift" me anything.  When was the last time the U.S. was under any sort of extistential threat? The territorial integrity of the U.S. was never even remotely endangered during the Spanish American War, WW1,WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq.  I guess the civil war counts but that was 150 years ago.  Let's just agree that the America you know is very different from the America I know.
this is a terrible analogy. we aren't talking about puppy killing.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem explains what /u/spacefoam is getting at. 
Bingo.  She currently views Bernie as a cute little pest, that she hopes, if she agrees with him on most issues, will have no problems defeating easily.  I think, and hope, that she has no idea what she may be in for.

On average, duh.. how can you even argue.. THAT is beyond naive.
Nothing--it can't be done.    You're born, life is shit, and then you die. If you're lucky, that middle bit is short.
Well if you have listened to GOP radio or television, they spew things about Obama being a muslim and hating this country, and it really gets people riled up and angry. These are emotional tactics, rather than policy that is used to coerce the key demographics (Typically older, and whiter folks) into voting. Thankfully none of these hateful things have started about Bernie (yet), but when we have an un-biased listed to this man, its refreshing. When we hear a politician talk about the struggles of the working class american, and how hard he's worked at ending government corruption (a topic that everyone agrees on), and removing money from politics with a common sense approach.. It really reminds people of the old republican party. It used to be known as the party of peace, of reason, and the middle class.
&gt;Defense IS a primary purpose of government while housing is not.  That's debatable.

Pipelines are safer than trains.  Why would you want to increase environmental damage by using shitty mean of transportation?
You just hate the rich and want to punish the job creators, you damn commie.
Sport. Home protection. The AR-15 is probably the best home defense weapon there is, period. Why ban semi auto? what is this the 1800s? Most handguns are semi automatic, bolt action rifles wouldn't work for defense. 
Most of the discussion on the right has been about failed Democratic policies in these cities for the last 50 years. 
If they said what they really thought, they would be applauding the deaths of innocent black people.  Yes, they are that bad.

Bernie Sanders thinks the FED should print a bunch of funny money and bail out Greece.  true story.
It's an excellent point.  These completely unproven accusations against the Clinton Foundation consist of nothing but vague innuendos and murky guilt-by-association claims.    The GOP get's two things out of this:  First, they smear Hillary Clinton with unproven rumors.   Secondly -- *but just as importantly* - they provide a  false equivalency narrative of "both sides are the same", that's become one of the most important talking points of the GOP.   &amp;nbsp;   Basically, they are trying to sell this:  * There is no difference  between Bill Gates giving money to the Clinton Foundation to fight AIDS in Africa, or Proctor and Gamble providing water purification systems in Haiti ---    and  the Koch brothers putting a billion dollars in untraceable, unregulated money into the campaigns of presidential, congressional and gubernatorial candidates -- then using ALEC to write bills for these politicians to pass.
What's a better alternative is the real question.

The Senate has a GOP majority.
&gt;It is possible to change the world, if you'd like to learn how or just have questions come visit us at /r/SandersForPresident. Everybody is welcome.   Unless they disagree!
Hilary ranks 11... out of a group of almost entirely conservative senators.  Sure, she's been trying to reinvent herself as a progressive in a lot of areas as the next presidential election looms.  That doesn't mean she's a liberal now, and it certainly doesn't mean she has a liberal record.  She's a moderate, at best.  - [supported the death penalty](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/06/nyregion/mrs-clinton-vows-fight-on-issues-and-image.html) - [supported three strikes](http://www.ontheissues.org/Takes_A_Village.htm) - condoned torture - [supported NAFTA](https://web.archive.org/web/20080323025752/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/03/from-the-fact-c.html) - [supported TPP](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/215817-clinton-vs-warren-where-they-disagree) - [supported prison time for flag burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005) - pro-NSA - wanted Snowden arrested and tried - voted in favor of the Iraq War - supported stronger regulation of video games - [voted YES on loosening restrictions on cell phone wiretapping]( http://www.ontheissues.org/SenateVote/Party_2001-300.htm) - voted for the PATRIOT act - voted to extend the PATRIOT act  This "11th most liberal" stat keeps getting trotted out as if it somehow cancels out all the very strong conservative positions that Hilary has held in the past and in many cases continues to hold now.
I strongly disagree with Bernie Sanders' positions, especially his avocation of centrally planned economics.  That being said - I have incredible respect for the fact that he is a genuine politician, an almost extinct species in this day and age. There are a few that fit in this category - Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Ross Perot come to mind.  Unfortunately this means the establishment will destroy him if he gets anywhere close to their monopoly of power.
If you read the article you would see it was written by two Associated Press reporters. Not exactly a right wing source. 
She's 65?? I thought she was very beautiful for a 45 year old!

Baltimore's Poor Not Helped by Liberal Policies. So, liberals call for more liberal policies and more money to throw at the problem believing the answer is too little of both. 
Ron Paul is a racist hack. Fuck him and the mindless sheeple who support him.
I understand but do TV spots and ads from someone with bad ideas make you vote for them? To me, that sounds stupid.
These two? Yeah, half of Reddit just jizzed their pants.
Most handguns are also semi auto. It just means that another bullet is rechambered upon firing. With rifles, it is either semi auto or bolt.
That was exactly how the establishment destroyed him - by smearing him and getting all the mindless sheep follow their lead.  Ross Perot received death threats, and the mindless sheep didn't care.  Bernie Sanders will also get smeared and defamed, and again the mindless sheep will be there to support the establishment.
If you think Sanders favors centrally planned economics in any meaningful sense of the term, I fear you are very much mistaken.  He's certainly not a Leninist, and in fact isn't much of a socialist. He's a social democrat, in the Scandanavian sense.
We need moderates. Much as I hate Republican policies, half of the country identifies as conservative and should have some representation, too.
Cheesemakers
Ron Paul is true to his libertarian principles.  You and I might disagree with his politics, but that doesn't make him any less genuine.  Bernie Sanders seems to be similarly genuine though of a much different political alignment.
If your boiling point is so low that a black man getting killed by cops makes you destroy other people's property, then maybe you should be locked away.
Good point. For Conservatives, what is done to me is unjust but what I do to others is deserved.
In age, sure. In sheer will, she's got it.
How can she? Her entire history in politics is exactly what Bernie is advocating against.
I heard there's that Bush fella running. I remember Bush, I like Bush, Bush is like my beer. I'm gonna vote fer Bush. A lot better thab that lying commie Clinton. Didnt we impeach him?   /s the average uninformed voter that consistently votes
Not killing people.
And then there was Alben Barkley, who liked to tell the tale of "the mother who had two sons. One went to sea; the other became vice president; and neither was heard from again."
&gt; It hasn't been true in awhile, but I remember we dared to go to the moon just 5 decades after setting flight in a rickety wooden plane. I remember a time when we graduated the most people in the entire world. I remember a time when all Americans shared in the highest standard of living the world has ever known.   And then Reagan.  And then Bush.  
This is the same thing Hillary Clinton said. A weak statement of support. There's no reason why Warren should not unequivocally endorse Bernie and she should lose a lot of credibility if she fails to.
Exactly, people don't realize the system is rigged
Sanders/Warren 2016
He's 73 years old and a self proclaimed socialist.  He cannot, I repeat, cannot carry enough states to win.  It is beyond a pipe dream.  Thus, reality.  
Ugh, that really grinds my gears!  Yea, we are going to really need to change the system this time if we want to have lasting impact. imo, that is going to mean concentrating on local and state elections (that's where we'll pass electoral reform).
Best to study the National Health Care systems in other countries before going this way. Sounds good on paper but --- well you know the rest.

OK, the slogan will need to be condensed into a bumper-sticker.
The bad perceptions may have a lot to do with all the proposed laws we keep seeing from the right though ... nothing around civil rights ... everything around restricting birth control, etc. Even in colorado they just rejected a pro-birth control program that was saving the govt there millions of dollars and reducing the # of abortions .... why? Maybe you can fill in the more "moderate" conservative reasoning behind such things? Or are the moderates being overridden by the extreme conservatives? What's it really like for you in the middle?
That stat is getting trotted out because its the best data driven response to the factually incorrect statement that Hillary Clinton is conservative. In 2015, in the United States, Hillary Clinton is clearly progressive, she is not the most progressive but she is progressive.
We have to have Democratic Presidents for a while to name judges to SCOTUS who will counterbalance the relatively young anti-democratic whackos that Republicans are responsible for.
Did someone say it was different?
No, because being vaccinated doesn't confer immunity.  When a group of people is vaccinated a majority of them will become immune to the disease. But a certain number will not.  Then why do we vaccinate?  We vaccinate to prevent the disease from becoming a plague or decimating the population.  By vaccinating everyone, we reduce the number of people who can catch and then retransmit the disease.  Once we reach a certain threshold of vaccinated people, and enough of them, statistically, become immune to the disease, they will not retransmit it to new victims.  Once that has happened the disease is effectively stopped in its tracks because it can no longer spread.  So the purpose of vaccination is to stop the spread of the disease, not to prevent the person who is vaccinated from catching it. Although quite often, and most of the time in fact, it is true that a person who is vaccinated will not be able to catch the disease. Most people who are vaccinated will be immune to that disease.  I just want to make sure it's clear that the purpose of vaccination is to prevent a disease from spreading throughout a population, not to prevent a specific person from catching the disease.   
Sorry, Ron is simply damaged goods , whatever role he plays. Sanders is simply too far ahead of the electorate.
Democratic Socialist, which is different that Socialism, unless you're in the GOP.
Wow. I have an extensive comment history. You have an article from several years ago when recruiting lowered standards temporarily... The waivers are header to come by now. Are you okay? I'm concerned 
The GOP itself started off as a party for disgruntled liberals who were sick of northern Democrats pandering to the slave-owning south.  But in the grand scheme of things, so what?

I would suggest recognizing that 99.9% of such people don't actually exist. They are delusions fed to you to keep you complacent as that .1% warlords in your name, with your tax dollars, against people that truly wish you no ill.  The terrorists are the ones keeping you scared... and it isn't the people across the ocean that are making you feel that way.
Its hard for a Dr to make more than $10k a week at those rates. 
One of the biggest hurdles to politics is that good ideas are not enough. You are also burdened by the fact you have have to win.  I've heard nothing but good ideas and good things from BOTH Warren and Sanders. The problem, though, is that they can't win. I don't think either of them could win the ticket AND I think they may have a tough time winning the Presidential, too.  Warren had a heck of a time beating a Republican in a very blue state. How would she do in a National race against the Koch machine?  Sanders is no better in that regard either.  Hillary knows how to WIN. The closest person to beating Obama for the Presidency was not Romney nor McCain. It was Clinton.  So, while I personally may like Warren and Sanders ideas more than I like Clinton, I MUCH more support Clinton in the next race because I want the Democrats to win. Clinton has the best mix of ideas and winnability for my money.
She's a pro-war, pro-corporate, pro-NSA, pro-death penalty progressive? We have a word for those - we call them "moderates." A moderate has conservative policies on some issues, and progressive policies on other issues.  Calling Clinton a progressive is what's factually incorrect. Progressives don't support endless war. Progressives don't "evolve" their position on torturing people based on changes in the political landscape.  If Clinton is a progressive, that makes Sanders sone kind of radical anarchist socialist by comparison.
I am a Sanders supporter. I have nothing negative to say about him, and I will vote for him in the primary. It just bothers me to see factually incorrect information being put up on this sub.   On another note, it doesn't do Sanders any favors when his supporters start reciting Fox News talking points and making unfounded claims about the other candidates. I'm sure he would say the same thing.
I was aware of that. 
He was smeared.  What did the newsletters say?  That "blacks are fleet footed" or something along those lines?  Have you seen the NFL?  I can live with that as long as authoritarian government is reigned in - which is why Ron Paul was smeared.  LBJ said  “I’ll Have Those N*ggers Voting Democratic for the Next 200 Years”  - this from the father of the "Great Society".  I think its the passive racism of liberals that I despise the most.
NCLB was a miserable policy that did little or nothing to help education. Homeland security came into being in a similar way to the the deciders Iraq war, due to the euphoria around Bush's 80%+ popularity for "winning 9/11" without losing sleep over Al Qaida.  
That arm grabbing is the dumbest pro gun argument ive heard yet  Guns are in the Constitution because people needed them at the time. If you can't find a realistic argument besides i want it, then you dont need it.
People like you will be the death of us all.
Democrats are a conservative party, they are a capitalist party, they are a party for the 1%. Same goes with liberals and progressives. The only difference is the social issues they care about and those swing with whatever is popular in the time. If the populous decides one day that pink is better than light red the Democrats and Republicans will pick sides and fight about it.   You can't be a leftist and also a Democrat. 
I agree but think you missed my point. Regardless of if there is or is not religious aspects doesn't matter. Religious people view it as a religious institution first and foremost that then the state recognizes. They do not view it as a civil contract between two people enforced by the state that is secondary. It to them is a commitment between the man, the woman and God. This is the issue and why they will fight it all consistently because you are trying to force them to allow marriage to changed to be between two men and God. Even if the people are not religious at all those that are will still view it as a commitment with God.   They are religious because they truly believe what they believe and no logical argument can change their mind so it doesn't matter if you tell them this is just a state or federal institution because that isn't what marriage is to them.   So three options either 1. You change their religious beliefs (not going to happen). 2. You over come the issue by law and keep the terms as is (this will happen just will take time) 3. You speed up the process by just changing the term for a state or federal sanctioned union from marriage to something else. This stop them from viewing the new term as a religious institution. Then you have the state stop even dealing in marriage and all prior marriages converted to this new term. 
Thanks for admitting you've lost this argument :D. 
Or better yet how about we spend some of it on that, and don't even bother spending the rest. Spending trillions of dollars we will never be able to pay back doesn't really work in the long run regardless of what it's spent on. 
Is someone who was lied to by decider and his entire crew.

&gt; Wouldn't your first goal to be to win elections, so that you can do what's best for the nation?  But he already won his election!  Ted Cruz is a fucking senator, and his term is for 6 years in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat to the senate since '88.   What has he accomplished as a senator?   His behavior looks more like someone who is in it for personal power and fortune.  edit: i have no idea why i started ranting about ted cruz. lol.

I remember it in 08.  Wasn't it Hillary or Edwards who won the Iowa caucuses and Obama wasn't even a big player in it.  Would have never guessed.  
NOTE: As stated, this only includes money which the U.S. funded the Afghan and Iraq Wars with--the rest of the Defense Budget would have remained the same in terms of employing 3.2 million people and fully funding the weapons systems/contracts which are budgeted for defense spending.  source for cost of Afghan-Iraq Wars: http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/publications/impact-newsletter/archives/summer-2013/the-costs-of-the-iraq-and-afghanistan-wars  ------------ 
Give me a break, that's not journalistic bias. It's reality. And they're reporting what "many see him as," which is pretty accurate because many do see him as just that.
You don't understand how the goverment works at all. Regardless of our debt that money would be better spent investing in our country. Such as education
Keeping the job you have right this minute is even more immediately critical than casting a single vote that likely won't make a difference.  Overall, it's critical the poor vote.  Individually it's a bad idea.
From what I know it isn't the money that's the issue...it's the possible conflict of interest of donations being received by foreign countries during her time as Sec State - and her failure to report those donations as was expected.    by the way, last time I checked, the Koch Brothers aren't the only millionaires/billionaires donating to political causes:  enter Soros, Steyer, etc.  But, it's *probably* only conservative donors who are responsible for corruption and cronyism in America's political system.  
Even though completely disagree with that viewpoint, I would not call that crazy. A civilized people work together, not against each other. But again, that's a philosophical difference, not something that says crazy.  I point to things like Paul saying businesses should be able to discriminate against people because the magic of the free market will fix it. That's crazy. 
Interesting that people seem to speak the greatest truths accidentally.
That's my point.  Imagine if she declared to be his VP before the primaries.  Would give Hilary a run for her money. 
Hope you remember your post 10 - 20 years from now. If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on you being a yuppie by then. Hopefully I'm wrong, but the probabilities are in my favor.
Yes exactly. Every candidate has different stances on a wide variety of issues. If you look at Hillary Clinton's stances AND more importantly her voting record on ALL issues, she is clearly progressive by any thorough analysis. Yes you can find instances where she voted in a conservative way, but you can find that with almost any candidate.  Here is another article on the matter...  http://crooksandliars.com/2015/04/hillary-clinton-was-11th-most-liberal
I would praise *(almost)* ANYTHING that strengthens the Blue Team, and ensures that the Executive Branch remains in the control of the Democrats, and NOT the warmongering, torture-crazy, economy-wrecking Republicans.
In most states, it is illegal for a company to refuse time off to vote.
I can see Warren becoming a Hillary-esque shill. Bernie has the voting record to back him up. He's genuine and we know it for a fact. Elizabeth Warren is a politician. She plays to the crowd. She will sell out just like Obama.
&gt;BTW, foreigners can influence American politics by through multinationals or perhaps other foreign funded entities spending money on advocacy.  True  APAIC pretty much runs the country.
A someone who has worked in the fire and emergency industry - fire departments are a gluttonous waste of tax payer money, symbollic of government waste everywhere.  Police departments?  Ferguson, Baltimore.  Nuff' said.   Based on these two examples - only a crazy person would support these state monopolies.  I highly recommend “The Anatomy of the State" as your first step into enlightenment.  
He still resisted arrest, which warrants force to subdue him.
A word count of a persons reddit account is not an accurate indicator of who they will vote for in the primary.   If it were, based on your word count I will assume you will be voting for the "false hillary foundation" in the primary.  I will vote for Sanders in the primary, unless another better candidate appears before then.
This is where your bias comes in. Ron Paul doesn't say businesses should be able to discriminate, just that the federal government doesn't have the authority to police such matters. That's a major distinction that, due to your bias, you completely ignored.  No one thinks that we shouldn't work together, it's just that we shouldn't be mandated to do so by a heavy tax burden. Many government programs are incredibly mismanaged and inefficient. Even places reddit likes to idealize, like Norway and Sweden, have nightmarish bureaucracies.
Honestly, these people aren't Republicans. There may be a handful of true Republicans somewhere in our government, but the right-wing zealots that are now the majority, they are Republican in name only. You can see this with their stance of government regulation. They preach against regulation, and then turn around and try to slap regulations on any vagina in their jurisdiction.
You sound like another really sorr gun nut. If you can't discuss an issue like an adult and just tell people asking questions to fuck off. You really aren't mature enough to own somthing designed only to kill and intimidate 
I can do that too.  The $22 trillion spent on the 'War on Poverty,' could have been used for so many other things. Instead it was used to 'boost' people out of poverty with no results.
Same as when reddit was in love with Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich. People like straight talkers, even if they might not agree with everything they say.
Good

&gt; A large part of it is returned to the economy because it is spent on US Defense contractors, military pay, etc...  mostly to defense contractors  it puts a disgusting amount of money into the hands of the few.  yes "back into our economy" but not as well as some other methods would have done.
I doubt the weapons are even made in the US anymore ... probably components from China, assembled in US.

Most of the depth in reddit is not the content creation but the organized discussion format.

Of course they vote Democrat. Why would someone who works for the government or relies on public funding vote against their best interests?
We must arouse the political consciousness of the entire country so that they may willingly and gladly fight together with us for victory. We should fire the country with the conviction that The U.S belongs not to the corporations but to the American people. There is an ancient Nordic fable called "The Foolish Old Man who Removed the Mountains." It tells of an old man who lived in northern Scandinavian mountains , long ago and was known as the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain. His house faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Galdhøpiggen and Kebnekaise, obstructing the way. With great determination, he led his sons in digging up these mountains hoe in hand. Another greybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively, "How silly of you to do this! It is quite impossible for you to dig up these two huge mountains." The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die my sons will carry on; when they die, there will be my grandsons and then their sons and grandsons, and so on to infinity. High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower. Why can't we clear them anyway?" Having refuted the Wise Old Man's wrong view, he went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction. God was moved by this, and he sent down two angels, who carried the mountains away on their backs. Today, two big mountains lie like a dead weight on the American people. One is corporatism, the other is greed. Bernie Sanders movement has long made up its mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we too, will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than the masses of the American people. If they stand up and dig together with us, why can't these mountains be cleared away?" 
You may not like it but its the truth, and its most likely due to the fact that blacks are poorer than whites and poor people are more criminal than richer people are.
Let's play around with this. Say /u/hornwalker hadn't come out of his/her house in ages, had no social life and no perspective on geopolitics. Say he or she had been playing MGS4 every day since the game was released and had zero interest in what went on beyond his PS3/television.  You know what? That point would still stand. So what's your input here? You're basically saying that engaging in an arbitrary activity invalidates people having an opinion about where their tax money goes.  I'll let you come to your own conclusions about your contribution here.
All you are doing is telling me you have no ability to critically think and see that welfare, redistribution, is no different than the military.
&gt; Ron Paul is batshit crazy and anyone who supported him is an idiot. Bernie Sanders is light years better and a polar opposite politically.  So all those active-duty military and veterans that donated to Ron Paul's campaign were "idiots"?  tsk tsk comrade.  I guess we can add the military industrial complex to the list of immoral atrocities that liberals passively adore.
Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636. 
r/politics is such a circlejerk
It's just about the only thing the decider party believes in.  We all exist just to fund war, not to compete.  It's all very backward. 
Yea baby, massive intrusive government, tax the rich to submission, central planning for your lives. Everybody will be equal, except the ones that make the laws.
&gt; The P.O. passed then House and 51 Senators were on record in support.  [51 Senators in support does not mean shit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster#United_States)  Democrats had a supermajority for a month and a half, which was the only time frame in which a major piece of legislation like the ACA could be passed.  You might be pissed that there wasn't a publicly administered plan but don't pretend it would've gotten past the Blue Dogs or Lieberman if mean ol' Obama had just supported it more.
I don't think that, strategically, this is a good thing to run on.  Many people support the ACA, many dislike the ACA, but I would think that many Americans aren't ready for another round of healthcare reform.
So if you don't discuss it, it doesn't happen? You should tell that to the poor children your religion has molested.
Fuck being moderate.  It be awesome if he picked a person who closely supported his views.  and its four years, Warren is a perfect age to take over if something happens.  and she could be trusted to hold the same principles. 
Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, too. 
There hasn't been a Republican mayor in Baltimore since the 1960s.  Every politician with power in Baltimore is a Democrat.  It is a shithole of failed progressive policies.  Why would the GOP need to comment on that? Let the facts do the talking.  It's clear that the source of anger and frustration isn't just over police brutality, but literally zero economic opportunity.  Unfortunately, all the constituents all Democrats and they'll just keep voting in the same policies that have put them in an awful position. 
Seeing that Bernie Sanders wants to effectively dismantle the NSA I'm going to guess you're going to see a whole lot of "Bernie Sanders 2016" comments coming from Eglin AFB IP's.  [Just a reminder that this is still a thing that happens everyday.](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/)
lol but the reality is, even if every idiot on reddit came out to support him, hes not rationally a good candidate for a # of reasons. he will get 0 votes from irritated conservatives, (hes a big union guy and you can see that in his donations.. and voting record)   he also is pretty anti capitalism, which some democrats and conservatives dont like.. the only thing he has going for him is he isnt hillary.. but many dont even know who he is,, and unless he comes out and blows hillary on all the scandles she is involved in, he wont have a snowballs chance in hell to et the nomination.  also regardless if it should matter or not, his age is a issue. (73 years old) the oldest president to ever be elected is reagan at 69 and was 77 when he left office after second term..   john mccain was 70 when he was a contestant in 2008 and many here suggested he was not a viable candidate due to his age..  yes he is a Slightly more honest than most politician, but his ideology will nick him alot with moderate voters.
Just a bit of advice - you'll want to remove that last comma.
Hillary will get the nomination. She stands the best chance of winning against the Republicans. You can't be a self-described socialist and expect to win over the country. 
I know he's reddit favorite, but we are all aware that there is zero chance sanders wins right? When polled, [barely 2% ](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/) of Democrats said they would vote for sanders. If hillary goes down catastrophically, maybe he has a slight chance of winning the primary, but there is no way, 0% chance, of this guy ever ever becoming president. 
You mean 40% goes to people who didnt plan and apparently have no family who cares about them. Which means they should somehow become *my* responsibility??
&gt; If he's stays in a week past super-Tuesday I'll donate. Sound good?  Jeez man, I was just going by your original proposal. I assumed that meant if he's still in the race for at least a week after Super Tuesday?
What exactly are you wanting them to say?  The cops are charged.  If they are guilty (looks like it so far), the they will go down.  If you expect then to join in the liberal chorus  of America being the most vile and evil place on earth, you're going to be disappinted. 
So i honestly can't think of any republican or person in general i find to be less intelligent then Louie Gohmert. He makes Ted Cruz seem smart, and he even looks stupid. I've never heard of any action or statement ever made by him that wasn't in the news for its absurdity. And of course there is the classic "casting aspersions on his asparagus" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE4fCcsw6Fs  Why the fuck is he the Chair of anything? I wouldn't trust him to play a game of musical chairs without hurting himself or someone else.
Seriously. These progressives are getting to be ridiculous. Also, you guys know that if Bernie wins the nom, we'll be seeing a Republican President, right?
good point, no need to downvote.      All I can remember about Biden is that hes like a creepy gramdpa who points at people and the camera.

It's worth considering that Sanders is unlikely to secure the nomination, but might be able to force Clinton into more progressive positions by threatening her from the left.
If it makes you feel better to lay this all at the feet of decades of "Liberal" mismanagement in Baltimore, fine. But who you going to pawn this guy on? http://wciv.images.worldnow.com/images/7376339_G.jpg
Money the government doesn't spend is money they don't take from you.  Overspending is useful in liquidity traps, not at all times.  Edit: apparently people seem to think that government should always overspend, and that it's always good...
So Obama says that the legislation his administration passes is absolutely necessary for the existence of the US? Every president would say that his policies are the only way for the US to keep existing. That's why you shouldn't use only politicians as source for the importance of a policy. (Yes this counts for every politician including Elizabeth Warren)  The real questions remain: Is unleashing the cooperation’s and financial institutes the right thing for the whole economy? The "Deutsche Bank" did already implicate it will sue the US for these "unnecessary burdens" it has to fulfill to be allowed to operate in the US after the crisis (Because the German government didn't had the courage to regulate them stricter after giving them billions of Euros.)  And why is this not be negotiated in the WTO? Also do you believe that the big concerns who are co-writing (sorry counsel) this bill have the best interest for the whole US and European economy (including small businesses) in mind or will only try to strengthen their position?  In my oppinion this bill is far to shady and "big buisness" to be good for the whole economy but of course this is hard to prove if it's made in secret negotiations.  
This is a city with a black mayor, a black attorney general, a police force that's half black, half of the officers involved are black, of the 6 police officers charged more than half are black, the cop that gave him the rough ride supposedly is black, every single council member is a democrat, more than half of them are black, they have a black Democrat Congressman, a Democrat governor, the US attorney general is black, and the President is black.  How is this a conservative or a white thing? 
The field of sociology isn't very balanced.  I bet if there was a department of supply-side economics it would be overwhelmingly republican, but that doesn't make supply-side economics right or republicans better informed.
It was government, not consumer spending. We could have had smaller deficits, lower taxes, and therefore higher consumer based spending and been better all around than waging these wars. Class dismissed.
You're talking about a mismangement of the symptom.  I'm talking about the *cause*.  Liberals use tax dollars to replace the head of the household in Black families.  If a Black woman gets pregnant, she gets food &amp; shelter assistance.  She doesn't need to rely on the father.  He becomes useless.  This breaks up the family.  Why don't Liberals even acknowledge this?  Do you think its bullshit?  
Right... because tax payers wouldn't be able to spend it
&gt; Domestic spending is fine if its intelligent, hand outs aren't if they kill the gov and increase taxes.   Increasing taxes is somehow related to "kill the gov?"  Otherwise, I'm glad.  Maybe we can make headway now in the ALEC run legislatures in Wisconsin, Louisiana, Arizona, and take on the defeatest attitude about research universities that they have purveyed and enforced across this nation.  
Unlikely? Same thing was said about Obama.  
Hillary spent over $200M to lose 8 years ago and before Citizens United. Though I'm guessing plenty of CU approved expenditures will go Bernies way via unions.
there is no such thing as a "trickle down" world
That's because you're a humanitarian and not a money-grubbing vampire.  Unfortunately the people running the show don't take very kindly to those kinds of perspectives, so war, debt and exploitation are *always* gonna win out over whatever namby-pamby commie shit you were talking about.
Forgive my reluctance to take what a politician says at face value.  At least Bernie has the track record to back up his statements.  Oh, Hillary suddenly agrees with Bernie on a lot more issues?  Right... I'm sure.
She is basically a young, black, female Bernie Sanders....wow, that was weird to type ... but yeah, exactly.  This wave of enthusiasm for Sanders needs to have coat tails if it's going to really do some good  -  and extend out to the states and bring more *truly* liberal democrats into the Senate.
Finally, they're doing something productive...
They'd be great if they'd drop gun control off of their agenda.  
Boo fucking hoo. It's a weapon. Until we achieve some kind of peace on Earth, newer and nastier weapons will be devised. Fixating on drones is pointless.
Sanders refers to himself as a socialist.  He also notes that he adheres to a form of democratic socialism.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/bernie-sanders-is-an-avowed-socialist-and-democrats-are-actually-pretty-ok-with-that/  However, in both cases, the lowercase refers to an ideology, not to a political party.
you fucks who cant do anything but make post complaining about "LE CIRCLEJERK XD" are what I hate the most. Find a new word to use dipshit
It's making the legitimate point that mainstream conservatives and pundits are selectively outraged and ignoring the issues that led to the unrest in the first place. I'm a conservative, but it's aggravating to see how Fox News and other "conservative" outlets are making their outrage selective and refusing to confront certain realities, then whining about how blacks and other people are stubbornly refusing to see their POV.
That's oxymoronic, faux philosophical bull shit. 
The human ego is a very ugly thing.  If you're rich, its practically a requirement to have a martyr complex about success and assume all poor people are either lazy, drunk or stupid.
Obama had just that, a "Super Majority" in his first term... but he didn't even attempt it. Right?
Hence the "at least" portion of my comment.

There is a difference between H1Bs and Immigrants - they are NOT one and the same.    H1Bs are sponsored by corporations / businesses.  H1B holders are not immigrants - they are imported workers.  H1Bs Indentured servants by another name, basically - low paid almost slave labor.  If an H1B holder ever QUITS working for the H1B sponsor - they go right back home.    Being forced to work for a company for low wages is NOT IMMIGRATION.  So many of my colleagues have H1Bs come here - they're forced to train their replacement, then fired.   BTW.  You think Immigrants aren't immune to the H1Bs?  You're dead wrong.  If an immigrant becomes a naturalized citizen, they're just as risk as a natural born US citizen with being replaced by an H1B indentured servant.  An IV visa is an immigration visa.  An F1 visa is a student visa.  F1 visa holders should be ALLOWED to become naturalized, and stay and work in the US.  Those, I support and have no problem with.    The system is really broken.    BTW.  I'm not some privileged majority whining about things.   My father's an immigrant - I'm half Arab.  I'm that "other" box in the Affirmative action chart.  I spent 10 years after I got out of college trying to get into my field ... because all of the jobs I qualified for are filled by hundreds of thousands of H1B holders.  At my work - half of our office is from overseas ; with random new people coming in for a couple weeks at a time - then going back to wherever.  These worker programs are not helping people, they're taking advantage of people. 
&gt; defeated as slaves and confiscated their wealth  We still do that, its called "free trade" or "globalization" and while its a bit more sophisticated than physically forcing your victims to work for free, the results are about the same.  We "arrange" to buy a country's chief export for a ridiculously cheap price - just enough so they can continue to operate, but not pay their workers a living wage. We make predatory loans through the World Bank and IMF, and our military intervenes or arranges coups when necessary.   Its still slavery, there's just a lot more paperwork and neckties involved... and its *absolutely* good for our economy. We depend on this system.
You are right and it's a good thing he wont run as an independent because he would take away a lot of the Democratic vote.    He wont get elected because the GOP would crush him for not being a Christians and being a socialist. And dumb Americans that only know what they see in attack ads won't vote for him.
Why not just mildly illegal? I'm ok with that.
Well with his overall great position I think the few things that he might need work on are small enough that he can easily be said to have the least bad of all the massively bad coming out of the political farms these days.  Love me some weekend with Bernie.

The question becomes who made money off of all this? Follow the money, find the crooks. Still as true today as it was for Sam Spade. And before you go off on a tangent of it was an attack that no one could predict, I suggest you look at the money made by certain people in the Kingdom, who actually DID make money afterwards as well as a lot of major defense contractors.   Not that I am saying it was staged , or not an act of terrorism, or anything else. Its just that someone knew, and they made money. Lots of it. 
That Lieberman stuff was a show for the rubes.
Part of the issue, for me anyway, is the electoral college. I'm from VT, and it's hard for me to swallow that even with 100% voter turnout, and if every single one was for the same candidate, in the end it wouldn't really be any different than 3 voters turning out and two voting for the same candidate. I do vote in every election, but even having done so, I'm left with a feeling that it was relatively meaningless.
You're not understanding what I'm saying. First, let me say that I fall quite a bit left from center. I'm not trying to make a statement about obstructionism or who's the bigger asshole. What I was saying is that any time you have one party running things across the board, you're alienating roughly half of the population. While the Democrats might do a better job than the Republicans do at governing their people, it still doesn't change the fact you are not representing a large portion of the population.   You can pass any number of hella-dope neo-Utopian laws, effectively wiping out poverty, sickness, and war, but at the end of the day you still have roughly half the population that feel under-represented and disenfranchised. [This is a symptom of our First Past the Post system, exacerbated by the option of only two parties.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo&amp;list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638&amp;index=1)  That's why I said we need compromise, because the act of compromise assures that a larger number of people are represented, at least in theory.

There is no such determination. Ever hear of the Scientific Method? 
Oh there's plenty of examples of political parties going batshit loony, and the Tea Party wing of the GOP is doing just that, and the ones who aren't don't have the balls to stand up to them.  There are also plenty of examples of a single political party, holding a majority, going absolutely batshit loony as well. In fact, I'd venture a guess that there's more examples of single-party governments mistreating their citizens than multi-party governments.
The President went because there is a group of anti-science business shills pushing an agenda for resource *exploitation* instead of resource *conservation* and they are part of the GOP wing of the government, for the most part.  And because that criminal Rick Scott thinks he can shield himself and Florida from climate change by not mentioning it.  Or at least ignore its considerations for short term concessions to his backers that further the rapid pace of development that is destroying the natural resources of the good state of Florida.

Don't want anyone reminding you that you're a participant in a circlejerk, hm? Too bad.
&gt; Obama raised $410 million to beat Hillary in their primary. We can match that.   Can you match the political machine, though?  The money is important for buying advertising and such, but Obama had more than money.  He had people.  People not just organizing at the "grass roots" level, but a large network of volunteers to get out the vote and get him the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination.  Money is a nice thing to have in politics, but it means nothing if you can't win enough delegates to the Democratic convention.    For that, you need voters.  Not just any voters, but primary voters.  These are folks who are often already involved in politics at the local level.  People who have volunteered to be delegates.  People who serve in the local party apparatus.  People who show up to town halls, work for campaigns, and canvass neighborhoods.   Assuming you could convince 3 million Redditors to donate in the numbers you're talking about, it means absolutely nothing if those people consider their donation to be a job well done, and stay firmly planted in front of their computer.  No, you gotta get involved in the "ground game."   FYI...that network of supporters that Obama had in 2008 and 2012?  They're on Clinton's side now.
good clip... I'm skeptical but if he pushes hard on economic inequality and soft on culture war it's not impossible
Because it says drone in the title. 
&gt;testimony isn't evidence  have fun playing word games with yourself.
Science is real, whether or not you believe in it.
Obama telling anyone political contributions are too much is hypocrisy considering he ran the most expensive presidential campaign to date. Hillary will blow that out if the water this year, with her 2.5 billion she is trying to raise. But all I see are complaints about the right, yes jack holes, keep thinking it's only one group at fault and we will keep on the current track we are on
Why didn't you sign up earlier this year? If you had a reason, there should easily be an exception available for you. The period is so that people don't wait to buy insurance until they need it. 
That would help, but a massive rezoning to encourage small business  is also needed. Also the city needs to adopt a more efficient transportation system.  Oh, and police brutality is a crime, it needs to be punished.
I agree, but I'll still be pretty miffed if he doesn't win the primaries.
Found the guy that thinks history is taught *objectively*, and not embellished/edited in order to indoctrinate students, restrict the narrative and ensure the citizenry's allegiance and compliance.  Tell me more about how school made you smart, though... That should be entertaining.
Hey guys!  Let's put reality up to a vote.  I say we repeal the Law of gravity.  Then we can explore space at a fraction of the cost.
Since when has Clinton been in the left?
wow thanks man! but honestly. my whole life i grew up "republican" just because my dad was. being in the military changed my views a lot. we all have healthcare. no deductibles. i paid about 50 bucks a paycheck. anyone should be able to go to the doctors and get fixed. there should be no business benefiting from the weak, sick and/or dying. ill pay more taxes or get no refund at all if he can really fix the infrastructure and give health care to everyone.  i served 6 years and got out almost two years ago now. I had to work a minimum wage job. I dont know how people are doing it. A huge hit to my ego I had to live at my parents house for a few months while working fresh market. how are people surviving on 600 dollars a month. you have to work 2-3 jobs. which leaves people no time to better themselves.  I will be voting for him. Bernie has been a breath of fresh air. I didnt know people like him existed in politics. There is probably a lot of people that dont know either and once they do i think he has a great chance.   Edit: i was thinking about the media thing. what do you think if he promoted himself on twitch.tv. i know it might seem crazy. but its free to stream. i dont know what it takes to get featured on the front page, but if he got on once a month it would get that whole community talking. he could answer questions in chat reaching a large group of people who probably dont care that much anyways. but him just being there could swing a lot of apathy into positive outlook onto the next election. i think he would benefit greatly. 
How will we handle the transition of the millions(?) of health insurance workers displaced by the removal of their livelihoods?  (I always understood this to be the biggest obstacle to single payer -- the vast portion of the current economy tied up in health insurance work)
I agree. The right has successfully convinced a large group of single-issue voters that the Democrats want to "take their guns," which just isn't true. If the Dems could appear to back off on the issue (I say appear because I don't think they push it very hard anyway), then that voting bloc wouldn't come out in droves for the Republicans.
I know she's a Republican but can they get on the same ticket please??

&gt;  the ACA is not a finished product.  Indeed.  Will get worse.   &gt; and done in the face of repubs and medical companies with enormous profits to protect.   Yes, they did this to protect those profits.  To cartelize the health insurance industry.   Unfortunately, you Dem partisans are a little bit delusional and naive about precisely how bad the American political system is. 
Notice how when a Republican says something good, the Liberal Reddit community doesn't upvote it.
No, actually it doesn't. It has to do with IQ (which is not intelligence) because tests are typically geared towards those in the middle and upper classes. But actual inherited intelligence has nothing to do with your income.   People with higher incomes can afford better schools, tutors, and test prep, but your genes have no clue if your grandmother won the lottery. 
What a sad world it would be, if everyone who disagreed with you was really as bad as you think.

This is not appropriate. If you are going to post things like this, at least have the courtesy to label it NSFW. This is a warning.
Extremely, extremely far left.  Edit: notice how all these comments have gotten downvoted. /r/politics doesn't like being called out on its bias.
Um, I live in NYC.  It doesn't get any bluer.  My vote doesn't count for crap.  And I always vote third party since my votes doesn't count, it might as well go towards installing a 3rd party, no matter how futile that may be.
This year's Correspondent's dinner was hilarious. President Obama was awesome, he really let loose. I hope Obama digs into the GOP even harder next year, it'll be his last one.  Anyone else remember how boring Bush's were and how shitty the entertainment was?  Here's Karl Rove rapping, absolutely cringeworthy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln5RD9BhcCo

Its an actual socialist theory accelerationism? Make things worse so more people would be willing to make things better.
It was one of the few times the common man had a little extra money. They had it because of a strong economy and then the wives went to work. For most people that has ended. The wives are still working but that is the norm not an increase in income. More and more people are have their job until the project is over or the have been moved to a contractor doing the same work they did before they were laid off.

What if the dog is aptly named tripod?
You mean the war party that illegally attacked Libya and has been endlessly drone bombing multiple countries overseas for years, not to mention using the same threat of terrorism to spy on us and attack our liberties at home? That war party? Because that war party is called the Obama administration. Not to say the GOP isn't just as bad mind you, but His Majesty Obama is their equal in war and corruption and has been since his first day as President.
Good point. She has the same "it's my turn" entitled attitude as Romney.
So why did my insurance premium  triple this year?
No that wasn't your argument. You said he voted for something he didn't. Your first reply to me was "those are the ones that supported the bill itself." I was saying no you were wrong about what you said. The person asked who the five republicans were that voted for the amendment mentioned in the original article, and I provided the correct answer. I never argued that Rand Paul didn't believe climate change. In fact, I even said in my last comment (since you brought up the entire bill, and not just the amendment I was referencing in response to someone) that 98 senators voted yes on the main bill saying climate change was real, including Paul obviously. You challenged my original comment, and you were wrong so I corrected you. I don't understand what you're going on about.
He may be a great writer but his ideas, especially those expressed in 1984, have been circlejerked to the point of complete meaninglessness. Is he such a genius for pointing out that oppressive systems are bad? What people have remembered from his work is "Oh my god, this is what *our* government is doing right now". If you can't see that he has become the poster child for an entire generation of altermondialists who are not part of your "system", man, then you're also part of that circlejerk.

A different perspective:  ------------  "Walter Williams and economist Thomas Sowell argue that the significant expansion of federal welfare under the Great Society programs beginning in the 1960s contributed to the destruction of African American families.[43][8] Sowell has argued that "the black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life."[43]"

Why is that sad? The guy is like Booker T. Washington. Brilliant but really only out for himself. He's only running to put out another book that his largely conservative audience will lap up.
I'm literally doing just that. The only way Bernie makes it through the primaries is with us skeptical non-affiliated folks jumping in on the action.  Actually, it's kinda appropriate. He himself is independent but running on the democratic ticket (surely because if he ran as an independent he'd throw the major election to the republicans).
Came here for this. 
If this guy gets people out to vote for him in a populist movement, other candidates on the ballot who share similar views would also win. It would certainly send a message.
A lot of what you mentioned is putting people into office... And a lot of that Obama didn't do, he's just taking credit for, huge difference 
Sorry but this reminded me of "abortions for some and little plastic american flags for others" when kang from the simpsons is running for president.
Yes it is. It is very troubling. How much of a millstone around our neck has Israel been? It is also troubling that you hold that erroneous opinion.

What? The drug war and education? No.
the same way it backfired every decade since 1776 when the wealthy influence and control government for their benefit.   /I can tell you the answer but I dont want to spoil it!

Yep, they won that in a low-turnout election. For the time being republicans will do ok.  2016 will be a huge show-up, whether it's Sanders or Hillary getting the nomination, so you can bet on a supermajority in congress.  Now wait until the latino vote grows and grows.  By around 2030, it will double.  And it is coming to many southern states. They don't like republicans very much for their stance on immigration.  And more and more people are accepting climate change as fact. Republicans being controlled by the oil industry and denying it in the media constantly is going to really be a problem for them.  Their anti-intellectualism won't help them in the future.  The thing about republicanism, is that their stances are based on hate.  And hate dies hard.  They're not going to adapt, their base is going to be drown out by the rest of the voting population, for these reasons and the ones I listed before.
It should be noted that a single payer plan failed completely in his home state.   Not saying we shouldn't have a single payer system though. Just thought people should be aware. 
That's a tiny minority of what was accomplished.  And all that in spite of Republican obstructionism. 
Reddit sure does like old white guys with "extreme" views trying to run for president.
can you give a source for this hypocrisy?

There's a multitude of reasons, many of which would take a long time to explain. Much of it has to do with perceived / market worth. If the whole planet is trading oil with the USD, that in itself adds value to it. It's a backing to the currency.  http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Economic-Hit-John-Perkins/dp/0452287081/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430627730&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=confessions+of+an+economic+hitman+by+john+perkins  Read that if you want to go further. This read can be criticized for the authors method of delivery, but it's a decent starting point.
Damn right. Those 51 Syrians. OBAMA!!!!   Obama promised he wouldn't create ISIS and bomb those 51 Syrians, but there here we are.  Please tell us what candidate *you're* thinking of who will truly accomplish substantial change? 
&gt;So if you don't trust the police who do you trust?  Myself and the 2nd amendment.   &gt;Just obey the law, it is as simple as that.  This phrase is only used by people living in the suburbs...

If you ever leave home and move to a big city, I promise you that you're entire outlook on law enforcement will change.  &gt;It's not hard at all to live life without encountering law enforcement.    Except for quotas that give cops incentive for false arrest and needless traffic stops just to preserve employment.

Neither Hillary nor Obama are moderate, you confuse having to be a politician that compromises and gets things done. Bill is the same. The GOP took over Congress and he had to try and work with them.   lesson to learn: voting for President then demanding change is not enough. you need to vote in midterms for Congress too
Our infrastructure is in disrepair. Its always a good idea to invest in public works.
&gt;I wonder if you think that the USA is the only country that contributes or does research?  Yup. The only one. No others do research.  &gt;do you think my single-payer system is cheap?  Don't you guys just pay in dank memes?
Is that acceptable to you?
Obama won by 4% of the popular vote in 2012. Hardly a "landslide".  edit: Okay down vote me people. I voted for the man, but 4% is no landslide.
This! Exactly why i scoff at anyone who says the military is fighting for my freedom. That was just the direct cost of the wars but it also took away from the recovery during the financial crisis. 
That is a whole other matter.  I am so done with money in politics.
These guys are clown shoes 
So much wrong with this list, but BOWE BLOODY BERGDAHL?  He didn't wave a magic wand or strong arm his release, he gave up terrorists.  Turns out Bergdahl walked off base to join the enemy.  edit: I'm sure we're down voting for content and not opinion. 2nd edit: "Wah wah, I love Obama and downvote because I don't like you pointing out that this was not an accomplishment, but a blunder.  Wah."
If giving a fuck about those who are crushed under the bootheel of our current neofascist version of democracy makes you a communist, then sign me up for the pinko commie revolution. I'm just tired of hearing how compassion is a prerequisite for being Stalin.  And to be Honest about it, if I have to live under dictators like the 1% are in this country, I'd at least like to have the meals and healthcare they want to deny us. 
You uhh comparing civil rights to shooting heroin?
The consensus is based on the significance of scientific data. You are correct, we never fully know all the answers - but that is no reason to stop researching. Among the scientific community climate change theory has reach irrefutable benchmarks - based on what we know, there is virtually no way to consider mankind is not responsible for the current rate of planetary warming. 
You seem to be one of those misinformed Americans. Most of the developed world does not have a single payer healthcare system. Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, France, Ireland, Greece, South Korea, Denmark, and Switzerland (to name a few) all have multi-payer systems.
They were talking about him on NPR and suggested that he's going to bring up a lot of things to force Hilary to take a stand on, IE take Sanders stand on, to make sure she gets his supporters.   In the end this may just be him trying to get his agenda noticed, and not actually a challenge to her bid. 
Reddit can link anything to the war on drugs, I swear.
Didn't he pass single payer in VT?  I know he did a lot of awesome stuff over there but I can't remember if it was something he was trying to get or not.
People aren't gonna vote for him because he's "not realistic," people aren't gonna vote for him because he's *not realistic*. He's to the left of the Democratic Party. The vast majority of people in this country are Democrats or to the right of that. If they voted in their own interest they wouldn't be, but that's just, again, *not realistic*. I'm probably going to vote for him, but let's not voluntarily put blinders in front of our eyes about why he's an unrealistic candidate.  My perfect President has views essentially identical to Bernie's. But let's not pretend that the only thing keeping Bernie from the Presidency is the majority *assuming* that he's unrealistic.
IMO the poverty line is a moving target. Even though theoretically it shouldn't be since its calculated by adjusting food prices to the consumer price index(or something like that IIRC), in reality the portion of household budgets spent on food have gone down and the stuff a dollar buys in 2015 is way different than 1963. And consumer products are just flat out better than they used to be.  Finally I consider I a lot of things beyond social programs to be "progressive". Infrastructure is one of those things. Education is another.
i'm not sure whats worse today.. mayweather winning or this
[oh I get it](http://replygif.net/i/1408.gif)
If you were talking about UHC, then call it that, don't call something that isn't single payer single payer. Especially if you are going to be calling others misinformed for not knowing what it is.  And, with the ACA, we are approaching a UHC with an Insurance Mandate, much like the systems used in Germany, Belgium, and Austria.
&gt; Thomas Friedman book  Didn't Friedman suggest that Capitalism REQUIRED regulation and socialism to move money to the bottom?
As someone that is 100% against the war on drugs and thinks it should be treated as a medical problem rather than a criminal problem.  No, it is not. This is the same argument anti-vaxxers use to get out of vaccinating their children.  It's your right to do what you want with your body within reason, as long as it isn't endangering other people.  You could argue drug addiction destroys communities and endangers people.
charisma was his main asset, not his politics, but really bush sr fucked gas prices as did his son
&gt;You could argue drug addiction destroys communities and endangers people.  Just like you could argue that about the drug war, or about obesity, or about many aspects of life and behavior.  In the end I believe it's far more harmful to take away my right to choose what I can do to myself than it is to accept that everyone deserves personal liberty.
The country will never change if you keep staying moderate. Being moderate today means"pro corporate", "pro NSA", don't challenge any important issues.  Imagine if everybody did that. One never supports candidates whose issues they support because because they are afraid moderates won't catch on. Remember, moderates (the majority of americans) initially opposed the civil rights movement at one point.  The majority of Americans also opposed women gaining the right to vote at one point. Would you have supported a politician who did not support these causes simply because they were more electable?  
I think people should be allowed to do what they want with their own bodies within reason.  For example I think people should be allowed to do drugs.  I don't think people should be allowed in public schools unless they're vaccinated.  Either way the entire war on drugs is stupid, but I don't think you can argue it's your right to do drugs or break the laws of the country you live in.  Even if you don't agree with a law, it's still the law.
Various .mil guys have come in and explained how that happens, but you guys keep preferring to stick with the fantasyland version.
In your opinion it is an unjust law, for the vast majority of people in the world drugs should be illegal and they believe that.  You might not agree with the morality of a law but that doesn't make it an unjust law.  I can't wake up tomorrow and say "I think I should be allowed to steal things because the law saying I can't is unjust" and that means it's fine.  Laws in general limit your freedom.  I can't drink and drive.  I can't run around naked.  I can't grow weed.  I can't do anything I might want to do, my freedoms are being limited by the law.  
They should stop collecting paychecks
Or one day you may wake up to the realization you don't qualify for any benefits and you're putting more into social security then you'll ever get out of it 
Aren't he?
I never said Single Payer. The OP poster did. I already said that I am referrring to universal health care. So I am not sure why you are still going on about other than to be a dick.  And ACA is literally nothing like Germany's healthcare. The ACA mandates buying FOR-PROFIT, PRIVATE insurance.   If one does not elimate the profit motive in the health care system, that health care system will remain broken. Germany has public health insurance free for everyone that is highly regulated. If the public option passed, maybe then you'd have a point.
Sadly, this is not how economy works. 
The right is a clear and present danger to the United States. I hope Obama does take them over.
So glad to hear you say that, I have been thinking on the same point. It would be all well and good to have Bernie shake things up but if we don't address electoral reform Congress will stay under control of R&amp;D for another 100 years.
Apparently Reddit doesn't care. The guy's behind by 50 points in the polls and is saying he's going to be even more liberal than Obama. Well guess what? Congress blocked every single one of those progressive agenda items. Now Sanders is going to magically take the lead, win the presidency, form a coalition in Congress and work with Republicans (because that's the only way to get a bill passed) to pass everything Redditors want?  Give me a break.   Usually at least one or two comments in these threads has somebody explaining the reality of the situation but recent Bernie Sanders threads are completely devoid of any reason.
Well it isnt like the arena requires formal wear like other celebs.

Obama take over??? I'm pretty sure Obama is the twice elected President of the United States, and that would include Texas. 
I understand the need for new research, especially since I support more funding for NASA. The thing I just don't understand is the need for a new war machine that will not ever see the combat it was truly designed for.   With American war technology we will never see jet on jet dog fights, especially seeing as we could just send a missile. We will never see stealth bombing missions with this craft, we have the b-52 bomber, blackbird and sr-71. And we dont need to truly upgrade from the A10 warthog for guerilla warfare assistance. Since we already have those planes and they work!  Sure this one plane is supposed to replace many we have but the thing is we already HAVE the planes we need. Why do we need the more advanced version of what we already do? Im not saying it wouldnt make things more streamlined but as a country are we so dedicated to making war streamlined? we already have the most funded, outfitted and trained military in the world, why do we need to keep upping the ante?  My point is we need to be funding actual projects outside of continuous war not feeding it. If the only argument is more beneficial research then lets fund that and not a new war plane that will add little to our aerial superiority.  Jesus there isn't a single country n power who would risk a war to aerial combat anyway so wtf?
Distribute funds 1st and 15th. 
I agree, that's like complaining that the police don't create better laws. The FEC is a group that monitors and makes sure laws aren't broken. They don't make the laws.
Well, at least you are being honest about it.  I just think you and those you purport to want to help would be better off looking elsewhere rather than trying to right a sinking ship.  But that is just my humble opinion.
I disagree.  I think he's much better off identifying with the Republican party so others who also identify with it will listen to him.  As soon as he becomes "liberal", he loses all credibility with the people he's trying to help.
Ok. I feel like the quote I provided for the title was a reasonable summary of the article, but I've resubmitted the link using the exact title of the article instead.
I never once said to become a liberal.
...you'll never know.  Funky motherfucker will not be told to go.
"That would be like saying get China the fuck out of Asia. Much easier said then done. "  No, because Asia is not a single nation. What you are saying would be more like saying to get Texas out of North America, which is not what I was getting at.   Texas, and the South, provide such a drag on US society, that we would be far better off without them. Their attacks on civil liberties, social progress, social insurance, education, environmental protection, etc. are the main problems in the nation right now.  
Well if he did win the primary the dems would throw their weight behind him or face a potential republican president and congress. And you're forgetting that the country only seems like that because only the most conservatives voting block actually votes. If Bernie can attract the youth vote he can win. Granted that is a pretty big if but it's doable.
This is why I love this man. It's such a shame other Democrats aren't like him. Rand Paul pretends to care, but the only true man who can restore America again is Mr. Bernie Sanders. Please redditors, contribute to his campaign!! Only together can we beat the warmongering, poor-hating GOP!  Bernie Sanders 2016, 2020, 2024 and forever..
Even Jon Stewart told the audience in the Daily Show that Sanders had no chance of winning. Very sad to see.

I do understand the concept of taxes, yes, and as a whole I realize that the workers in the country are providing the money necessary to pay for these government services but the minimum wage here also reflects the higher taxes and incomes are generally much higher. The society supports one another including young people (who have never worked or paid taxes in their life) and elderly people (who have contributed to society all their lives). Young people don't have to worry about how they will pay for school, they don't even have to worry about getting a part time job if they don't want to because if this monthly stipend that the government gives without any requisite of paying back. Elderly people similarly don't have to worry. It's also not like I didn't pay taxes in California, sure they were lower but it's much more difficult as a young person to navigate your taxes and insurance and education payments straight out of high school than it is here where it's all pretty much just taken care of by "the system." 
Where did I make a particularly partisan comment in this thread? Don't grab for straws that aren't there. I know people with nothing better to say are just going to ignorantly down vote me. I'm ok with that. Just don't put words in my mouth.
Good point. The difficulty with great debt is that as income has decreased so has financial mobility. This then becomes a long term problem, in some cases a generational one, where debts incur a greater social price. It's why wealth is considered as not merely income but assets, portfolio and mobility. 
&gt; Broke the Color Barrier  My favorite.  Who comes up with these lists?  
Just watched that episode of Crash Course US History...I wonder how many more references I will understand?
It's not supposed to, you're not supposed to be working these jobs after graduating high school. Get an education and a real job.
"Ninety-Nine percent of all new income generated in this country is going to the top 1 percent."  And this all happened while Obama was in power.  Will r/politics connect the dots?  Doubt it.
This is not true from economical standpoint and people should be ashamed of repeating such fallacies over and over.
Barely. Politicians lead from behind on social policy; take the dopes on the Supreme Court, for example, who think money equals speech and are actually struggling with the concept of treating gays and lesbians fairly. Economic policy, however, can be changed drastically depending on which party is in power, and done so with a quick vote and the swipe of a pen. Money is power, now more than ever in Washington.
The reason so many Republicans are running is because they're confident the next president will be a Republican.  If they were convinced they'd lose, there would be a much smaller field.   Berney will almost pick up 10% of the primary vote.  Hillary will squeak out a victory after a brutal fight with Jim Webb.  The economy is going to nose dive into a deep recession early 2016.  Hillary will go on to get crushed in the General Election against the Walker/Rubio ticket.  I have seen the futures.  
I'm new to economics. Why should the government provide free condos to people for free? Would it not be better to provide them work, so they can buy condos on their own, while making the economy grow?
Health insurance companies aren't actually all that profitable. A fortune 500 health insurer makes about 3% profit. Other industries can make much more than that.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/06/27/profits-in-health-insurance-under-obamacare/
Suppose the millions, (perhaps billions), that will be spent by both parties isn't enough to buy the election? Suppose all that money spent on all that old tech, last century, media didn't work? If enough people finally get fed up and refuse to allow our political system to continue to be bought and corrupted, it can happen!  People are beginning to get a, "fuck you, fuck your money, and fuck your bought and paid for candidates", attitude! An honest candidate, a peoples candidate, with a real message, no longer needs the support of the wealthy. No longer needs the rusty old political machines' support, money, or mainstream media to launch and sustain a meaningful, dynamic, successful, campaign.  How much did the last hundred videos that went viral, all hundred of them, cost, and how many millions did they reach? How much do the most popular and followed on Twitter and Facebook spend? How information is stored, dispensed, obtained, and evaluated is a whole other animal than what it used to be.  We can't legislate money out of politics, it's far too late for that. What we can do, is make their fucking money, their lobbies... their power, impotent, meaningless, and ultimately, wasted! What if they threw a billion dollar campaign, and nobody came, nobody paid attention, and nobody gave a shit?  Sorry for the long rant, but we really need to at least try to do something to change the ugly, corrupt joke our political system has become.
I like this new Bernie Sanders meme. Keep 'em coming!
Thank you. Minimum wage is for ONE person. Hence the term, minimum. I don't give a fuck if you have nine kids. Should have paid attention In school and applied yourself instead. Can. Not. Stand. Americans in America saying they aren't where they want to be because of somebody else, or this reason or that reason. Cowardice and ignorance all rolled into one. 
anything to kill military people so as not to pay them what was promised.  Classic GOP.

There's a lot of the federal workforce that needs to be out on their asses.  Like 90% the DEA.  99% DHS  100% the NSA  30% the FBI  50% the department of the treasury (secret service)  Any of the border patrol/INS not enforcing the sovereignty laws of the united states.  The drones at the DMV  And that's just the ones I can think of off the top of my head
&gt;Who was in the middle of arguing for net neutrality? Verizon, Comcast, Google, I mean, all these companies were playing. They weren’t saying ‘we don’t need this;’ they were saying ‘we need it.’”  It amazes me that Republican candidates can get away with such outright lies and deception.  How can you blame the average voter for voting Republican when candidates like Fiorina can openly claim night is day and not be held accountable by the media?
Wow. Is there anything Bernie can't do? How's he plan on ending world hunger, ensuring world peace and curing the common cold? 
I agree... the parentheticals are me fumbling through not accepting those cons at all.  I definitely think that medicare would be beneficial because you don't have to turn around and pay an insurance company.  Or you employer doesn't artificially reduces your salary by offering you this "benefit".    Also wait times here are already ridiculously long.  What I was trying to point out the callousness of people making that an issue.  They claim that their wait times will increase, because people can use the services they previously couldn't get or afford.  So your "quick" appointments are dependent on other people suffering.    Wait times are because of fewer doctors... do you want more medical personell?  Student loans need to have a lower interest rate and/or offer refinancing.  If you think undergrad loans are bad, you should see what happens with professional school.
This is a bit of an overgeneralization.
Post title is inaccurate. There is a difference between the National Guard and the Texas State Guard.
It's not enough for one person. You really seem out of touch if you think people are complaining that it's not enough for a family. It's far worse than that.   And one thing that really strikes me is that, for reasons beyond me, there no shortage of idiots who cannot comprehend that we all depend on various minimum wage jobs every day of our lives. Who's going to get you your coffee? Who's going to stock all the food and products of countless retail stores out there for you? It's not all teenagers in high school or college. There will always be people working those minimum wage jobs because society depends on it. You depend on it. You could not live your life without them. Show some respect for once. 
Basically, your position is, if it's an executive order you don't like, it's tyrannical overreach, if it's one you don't mind, then hey what's the problem.
I survived for 3 years making less than 10k/yr. rather than ask for more I used it as motivation to learn new skills and better my life. 10k became 22k became 45k became 61k became 85k. And I didn't have to ask anyone to increase my wage. I had to work hard. 
No they actually think down there right now that this is the beginning of his plot to end the presidential term limits and outlaw elections so that Obama can finally become the supreme leader for life. I really wish I was shitting you, but I'm not. That is actually what these idiots truly believe t these walmarts closing during military training exercises means. 
I just threw them in because fuck them 
no. thats not what my comment says at all....please dont regurgitate things you have read and not actually use your brain to think things out for yourself first.   I said i put up money every month. mandated yes. When i need treatment i should not be paying more money. If the entire country was pooling money every month into healthcare there is more than enough money to support someone when they need treatment. The military healthcare and it works just fine. you walk into the office and you are seen. if you need treatment you get it. you dont pay anything.  people should not be profiting off the sick and dying. go on any stock market viewer like yahoo.finance. the healthcare market has risen by 200% in 52 weeks. it has been better for shareholders and investors more than it was supposed to help the people.  
That's not how that works. Independents don't run with democrats. Sanders declared himself democrat to run in the primary. Independents aren't a unified group. They align wherever they want to. Closer to left or right depending in the person.
Do you mean members of congress voting anonymously? Anonymous voting doesn't work in a representative democracy because people need to know that their representatives are actually representing them. 
If you're trying to support a family with a single minimum wage job, your problems are worse than financial. 
Gated communities in rich neighbourhoods of the world's capital cities. 
Dude what? Just breifly going down the list I'm seeing a lot of errors. Obama made the Bush tax cuts permanent. The Iran deal isn't even revealed yet. The war in Iraq has not ended. Obama WANTED to go to war in Syria and only didn't because of the massive amount of people who called in (and he still sold weapons to Syrian rebels).   Also "Preventing the second Great Depression" and "Broke the Color Barrier" seems to be stretching a bit. I'm too lazy to go through everything, but just saying...
Obama has vetoed 4 bills so far, FOUR - that's it
So no source for anything you're saying, gotcha.
Congress and senate were also set up for gridlock by our founding fathers. The system is made so decisions have to be hard to make, and random wackjobs can't push their agendas through overnight. Unfortunately, we've got some very creative lawmakers who have learned the nooks and crannies and use the system to their advantage when they want to, and let it function as normal when they don't.

&gt; Broke the Color Barrier  Is that like the sound barrier or something?  But seriously, do you think race relations are better or worse than 6 years ago?
I feel like Obama's reply should be to deploy the national guard to quell the the Texas Republican coup.
It only impacts workers on the margins. 
We can start one. How are you?
&gt;They only own **some**...  I'm aware, thanks. I actually live next to a private toll road.
As a Canadian I liked him till I found out he's  anti NAFTA. 
Right. Become the manager instead. Problem is that only works for one person, not all of them. McDonald's only needs so many managers. The rest of the staff survive off my taxes. Not acceptable. We're a better nation than that. Our workers deserve better. 
All I can say is that Bernie Sanders really makes **sense** with these proposals.  If it's too late, after 25 years making these statements, and then carrying them though, then I think we've got a real problem.  Maybe it is to late, but I know I'm going to do EVERYTHING to have him elected.  It's time for a change.
I just don't think a self-described socialist will get a lot of votes in this country. I honestly think that alone will pretty much disqualify him. 
Nobody cares about the current ones, either. That's because this election isn't about character, it's a choice between Crazy and Not Crazy. So if the Clinton Foundation was feeding refugees with burgers made from ground kittens, she's still going to be saner than anyone the GOP can put up.   The GOP going to the stupid extreme has lowered the bar so far for Democrats that they don't even have to try to make a populist appeal. Go ahead, vote for the batshit crazy guy. We all know what happens when Republicans have power. It'll be W all over again. And they're even likely to put another Bush on the ticket just to reinforce that idea. 
Maybe question the wisdom of trying to raise a family on a minimum wage salary first, Bernie.
Are enemies still fear the US, it's just are allies think we're partially a huge joke as a result
Still syria. ISIS only popped up because we wouldnt air strike assad which meant that we cant stop an oil pipeline from being built there so instead we'll wage war by proxy to delay its construction. This would increase Chinas productivity, lower prices and reduce a large amount of money for our greatest ally Israel. (Go look up their relationship and monetary funding, i find it amazing how ISIS completely sidesteps Israel despite how violent muslims and jews are with each other)  History is always about money, follow the money. Just like if you wanna know why obama vetoed the keystone pipeline, go look up his rich friends that own the current means of this trade with Canada.
Your attitude? 
It has collapsed officially. The rest of the world no longer considers us a democratic republic. We're considered to be an oligarchy. So it's not really a matter of opinion.   http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy
Trust me, if Hillary gets the nomination I'm voting third party.
[deleted]
Is Bernie running with the Democratic party or as an Independent? Either way, Hillary is not the candidate the Democrats need in 2016...we need BERNIE
I understand, but I don't know who will be affected by the increase. 
[like this?](http://cosmopolitanreview.com/how-i-survived-socialism/)
&gt; Why would it result in inflation for a small subset of workers to see an increase in wages?  Places that predominately pay min wage would be raising their prices. Ergo, there would be a noticeable rise in prices in those places. And since many of the poor do go to such places for food, they would see inflation.
Your attitude is one of the reasons UHC fails to get supporters among everyday people.  I don't want to be able to pay for it to "show superiority", I want to be able to pay more so I have the potential option to escape bad care if necessary.  It is simply impossible -- *impossible* -- to give the absolute best care, at all times, instantly, to every citizen. If you think other countries do this, then you are naive. Life isn't equal, and it will never be equal (and shouldn't be equal -- more productive people should be rewarded).  But what is fair is to give everyone the opportunity to earn wealth, and if it's a priority to you, apply that wealth to your health care through supplemental insurance or whatever.  But when I read what you wrote, what I see is, "The government should FORCE PEOPLE to NOT be able to buy the health care they want! If the government can't provide them what they need, THEY SHOULD DIE rather than be able to live through buying something that someone else can't afford." In other words, everyone should have to live to the lowest common level.
Just the other day the Democrats sent in national guard troops to ensure the salmon we're allowed to spawn upstream, so yep,  both sides are the same.  
Major Major Major Major.
&gt;Wouldn't the minimum wage being raised to $15 dollars an hour result in rapid inflation?   Yes.  &gt;Would people who make significantly more be compensated for the wage increase?  Eventually yes.  &gt;Couldn't this create job loss resulting from electronic replacement?  Yes.  Now if you look closely at your post and the comments you'll notice two things:  1) You're being downvoted for asking a legitimate question.  and    2) No one is addressing what you've asked. Instead you'll see people arguing something along the lines of "This is America goddammit!" We're the richest country in the world! People can't live on $7 an hour!"  Most people on /r/politics can't move past their initial gut reaction (it's a well-intentioned reaction to have). The fact of the matter is that a $15 minimum wage will end up hurting the people it's attempting to help.  
They're losing power and clinging desperately, so they invest to slow down their loss from a flood to a trickle.

And in a few years, the *textbooks* that are published in Texas (and used by schools across the country) will be tailored *first* to the needs of this fundamentalist theocracy.
I like Sanders and all but quit making shit up.  Hillary has also brought it up and is in favor fixing it along with most all Democrats.
So my free speech should be limited?  I shouldnt be allowed to buy an ad in the local newspaper saying, *"Write to your congressman about climate change?"*  &gt;  election ads cause harm and shouldn't be allowed.   You saying so, doesnt make it so, they get awareness out for candidates, parties and issues: how is that causing harm?  How is me making an ad about climate change awareness, causing harm?  &gt; you simply can't pay to shove it in the faces of people who aren't seeking it out.  Freedom from speech is not a positive right and doesnt exist anywhere  And how is Elizabeth Warren making a campaign ad, shoving it in the faces of people. She buys the ad from a tv station, that doesnt force you to watch.  If you dont want to see her ads, you dont have to buy the newspaper or tv stations she makes them on.  There, problem solved.  Just like no one forces you to watch the worst reality tv show, no one is forcing you to watch Warren commercials. 
Serious question, and I would appreciate answers rather than just downvoting the wet blanket to oblivion.  I'm guessing that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters don't remember what Obama ran on the first time. It was "Hope and Change" -- he was saying many of the same things as Bernie Sanders. He wanted to fundamentally change how government worked. He wasn't as populist as Sanders, but there much of the same starry-eyed dreaming that Obama "cared about the poor and middle class" and "we would finally have someone who got it." I still remember reading some young voter who was filled with pride that she voted for Obama and she felt invested in fixing the future!  Well, Obama got a few things done, but does anyone *really* think he delivered on his promise of "Hope and Change"? Now, most people will scream at this point, "REPUBLICANS BLOCKED HIM!!"  I think what many people don't realize is how dirty a game politics really is. It isn't new. People have been dead-set against a lot of big programs that got passed, but Presidents have got them passed because *they weren't afraid to get dirty*. They threatened, they cajoled, they bartered, and they GOT THINGS DONE. The left HATED Reagan, yet he got things done. To be an effective President, you have to be willing to do what's necessary.  When has Bernie Sanders ever demonstrated that kind of leadership? He talks a lot, but when has he ever, through sheer force of personality, gotten something done? Obama did a LOT of talking, but a President has to be a tough SOB otherwise they're roadkill.  Do you want someone who says what you want to hear, or do you want someone who can *get things done*? Why in the world do you think Sanders can get anything done?
I think Bernie is aware that if he pulls a nadar the country will be far worse off as a result
Why? I understand voting for candidates you believe in, but wouldn't it be better not to get 2-4 new right-wingers on the supreme court?
Because they work just as hard as 90 percent of your population combined.  Duh.  They earned it you free-loading commie.
Yes, raising the cost of labor means fewer businesses can afford all or some of the labor they have. So people will be let go.
The most obvious statement ever
This man is who America needs. That's why Hillary will win.  Edit: Apparently Reddit thinks I'm not doing anything but complaining. I've donated to his campaign and been trying to spread the word the best I can. My original statement isn't necessarily how I feel, I was just stating that it feels like anytime I, or in this case a large majority of Reddit as well, want something good to happen,  the opposite happens. I apologize if I have offended anyone.
The neoliberals pushing the trade deals have written the concept of market being everything into them so they expressly reject the concept of minimum wages, basically they endorse the concept of race-to-the bottom exclusively. So expect the WTO to strike down any form of regulation on wages once work becomes international because it is likely to be seen as a :technical barrier" to trade in services. 
Partly because it's true. He has no SuperPAC so his campaign contributions are limited to the individual max, which is fine anyway because he doesn't have corporate backing or a billionaire or couple of millionaire patrons to funnel through a PAC to fund him. Which is entirely the point. He's not in this race to be president out even the Democratic nominee as much as he's in it to push issues like how crazy it is that the richest people in America get to decide who even runs for president while the wage gap widens.
Thats true, but, I was comparing us to somewhere like a Middle Eastern country, where there is a wealth of natural resources, but a tenuous populace under actual war conditions. Though one could certainly successfully make the comparison you make, there is still a difference of degree and amount. The populations you mention in the United States are still in the minority, and can be easily overpowered by both the larger popular sentiment, and the military police state which has become more military than police in recent years. In other countries, you're talking about ethnic groups that make up close to half the population (over or under). It's more difficult to keep these groups *under control,* which is why those countries usually have militaristic dictators or similar.   Our elite can control the general population with fear and division and propaganda. They also *benefit* from casting the minority groups you mention, as the *other* to be *feared.* It keeps divisions among the general population fresh, and keeps the eyes off of them. The gun violence you mention is largely in-fighting, and not a threat to the elites.
Building a viable 3rd party is infinitely more important.   We are never going to move forward in this country as long as the two parties run the game.

So what. Someone has to eat the higher cost of labor. And since many of the lower classes go to those establishments, they will see a rise in prices.  Not to mention, those put out of work, so the business can survive, will see their cost of living explode. Suddenly, everything becomes too expensive, for them!
I was just fucking with both of you guys. Rand Paul 2016 forever.
Because Sanders gets a lot of his campaign money from unions. [Source.](http://reverbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Campaign-contributions-Hillary-Cilnton-vs-Bernie-Sanders.jpg) Minimum wage hurts the poorest of the poor and helps the slightly less poor and middle class, like skilled labor and unionized workers.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1Moeaa-W8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQj1qlsjVoM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjD23OcVJvk
Workers need to end the push towards trade in services because that is likely to result in minimum wages being struck down by the WTO because they will be framed as a barrier to firms from partner countries to get contracts in US businesses that they are entitled to by virtue of being the low bidder. It will be completely different ballgame. As soon as trade in services becomes international, international trading bodies gain jurisdiction. They cannot strike down local/state/national laws per se but they can impose huge fines until they are changed.   For example, Dutch firm prevented the Slovak Republic from adopting a single payer health care system, framing it as a theft of their expected future profits- Thats called "indirect expropriation"  Google it.
Did you think only conservatives would make fun of crazy partisanship or something? That's ummm...interesting.
Ummmm.... I didn't know the founding fathers were into socialism...  I understand it really wasn't a 'thing' back than, and I whole hearty agree the wealth distribution in this country is messed up and Bernie would do his best to fix it if elected. But, I don't think it's really fair to characterize his stance as "dangerous freedom."  He's a socialist, and most of the Founding Fathers where in favor of *laissez faire.* (Which don't work, but they didn't know that)  His is pretty far away from most of their stances across the board, in't he?
A politics by nomenclature approach is extremely simplistic.
[deleted]
&gt; It's one thing to argue that the minimum wage increase will cost jobs, but it's not an inflation (monetary) issue.  This is correct. The reason Sanders supports minimum wage is because almost all of his campaign money comes from unions. [Source.](http://reverbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Campaign-contributions-Hillary-Cilnton-vs-Bernie-Sanders.jpg) Minimum wage hurts the poorest of the poor and helps the marginally less poor and middle class(like skilled labor and unionized workers).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1Moeaa-W8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQj1qlsjVoM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjD23OcVJvk

I generally agree with you, but the biggest issue for me is currently "he who has the most money has the loudest voice". How do we effectively correct that imbalance?
Also because if he runs as an (I) it'll be that much harder for him to get his message out. I doubt he has any delusions about winning but being a (D) means he can go to debates and at least try to talk about his ideas.
I believe that's genuine bullshit. You've got a GOP majority congress because of a few million people who live in flyover states. That is the definition of tyranny.
1 - Don't you have anything better to do on a Saturday night than respond to a topic whose last post was almost a month ago?  2 - Nobody mentioned Kansas, you bringing it up is irrelevant. It has its problems but I'm sure they'll be fixed with time. How's Baltimore doing by the way? Seattle? Detroit?  
so just because you fell on hard times and lost the job you had, so to try and support your family you take whatever job you can get, that means we should question the person??? are you fucking serious? You are fucking ignorant, igaf if it's an ad hom in the middle of this, you are ignorant to the real world. I'm not saying minimum wage should allow you to live a glamorous lifestyle, but our current minimum wage can't allow you to live anything but a shitty ass life. You try to survive off of $1100/mo *before* taxes, and this is assuming your boss let you work "full-time". Now try to survive while raising a kid on that same amount.   Oh but there's assistance, food stamps, etc. Yes there are, but WE SHOULDN'T RELY ON THAT SHIT. It should be there to help, not as something we should expect people you live off of.
Dno if you don't already do this, but you'll get a lot more reasonable and purposeful discussion in the smaller subs. Just mentioning it cause it took me 4 years as a redditor to figure that out :D
Where have you been the last 20 or 25 years? Also, are you aware of ISDS? Indirect expropriation? The WTO? TISA,   Lets start with the basic concepts behind trade agreements. #1 Investor State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS.  Corporations get a right to the continuation of the state of affairs that existed at the signing of the FTA forever.   I am not aware of any exemptions for any kind of regulatory adjustments being written into these things. Countries have been sued for passing increases in wages after they have been signed. (A french company sued Egypt for raising some minimum wage after the Arab Spring.)  That is teh way they work. Also, one of the main elements of TISA will be a global procurement stsrem for services contracts.. contracts to do jobs, for example in newly privatized former public services in the 50 TISA countries. How could minimum wage laws be challenged. Low bidders firms from other TISA or WTO countries main advantage is low wages..   When TISA passes, initially, existing minimum wage and immigration, licensing, etc. laws will likely apply. However, right there in the agreement it says that laws that do not comply with the agreement must be conformed to it. THOSE are binding, Almost nothing in Fast Track is binding, its just advisory.   If you want to read that in black and white it is in the leaked TISA and TTIP documents.   They also enshrining GATS Article 1:3 in stone as their only exception for what government services are exempt from mandatory privatization. That means almost all existing public services without almost any exceptions must not only be privatized, they must be monetized in such a way that more money always gets more services which means poor people have to get much less because they have musch less money. Anything else is "trade distorting". This is reality my friend, you are living in the 20th century if you think that people are going to get wages raised just because they cant live on what they get.   Services firms from other countries will be given all those jobs soon.   They will become legally entitled to do the work without any form of discrimination against their corporations. Laws that require that some workers be women or minorities or literally any law which might culturally be alien to them, any dictate on how they operate is likely to be struck down. All set asides of any kind, all preferences for businesses which have women or minority ownership and indeed, almost every law created in the latter third of the 20th century is deemed less important than facilitaing international trade and not discriminating against corporations.  This is what people voted for, Obama. the Chicago School neoliberal. The privatizer real estate attorney, who had worked with slumlords.   They see these minimum wage laws as a trade barrier to entry because they keep foreign firms advantage from being so evident.   Laws requiring that all workers be paid at least x wage would prevent them from getting jobs they would be entitled to because their main competitive advantage is low wages. This is the world today. The concept of a wage being living would prevent the entire race to the bottom. It would prevent the huge profits to come as jobs vanish. So they have to get rid of it.  You just don't get it.  
I think avoiding calling things what they are because of biases is what's simplistic.
While I agree that nobody should start a family on a minimum wage job in the first place, I feel like keeping it at 7.25 begs the question: the minimum wage to achieve what, exactly?
Good point
20 years from now... "We are never going to move forward in this country as long as the three parties run the game." I'm not saying that you aren't right, I'm just saying that the electoral system is very broken, and one extra choice isn't going to change that. 
"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." -the Gipper  Republicans believe it, and still set out to prove it.  
Bernie **AGAIN**???
Especially the ones who's marginal benefit to their employer is also below the new minimum wage.
&gt;  With no bargaining power, labor's share of the national product has fallen to an historic low.  Which is why we no longer make steel. The unions put them out of business.  Which is why min wages no longer allow wage bargaining for many. it also makes labor more expensive and costs people jobs.  I agree with your sentiments, but the reality is that most of our problems are caused by the govt. Bernie's solution is more govt. it's time to reverse that.  &gt;The crisis of the market is summed up by the question: Investment in what?  To listen to the progressives here, it's not investing in labor, it's investing in spending what you make. They dont want a labor economy. They wanting a debt and spending economy. And the reason for that is so they can export our inflation from printing.
It's a federal law for a federal program. There is no state override. I do try to make my representatives aware of possibilities, but I get a general response much like a pat on the head. Well it still can't hurt to try.  Anyway, I agree that we can't have people selected for positions of power, but competence and ethics and a wide inclusion of many aspects and perspectives and one reason that advocates who deal with people in need be included and have important and valued input. If done right the Manhattan Project will be childs play because a new system must hit and work. Pilot programs certainly, but even then we can't institute an inflexible and immutable system with the best of intentions. The thing about Berhie is he is more likely to consider needs and rational approaches since he doesn't have a party he must sell out of a sense of obligation. 
TIL 80% of people in the USA earn minimum wage.  And 2 income families is the worldwide standard now, and it's here to stay.
No.   Looking at the context does not support the narrative of, "hur durr, Texas!"  Let the TSG spend the next couple of weeks looking in on these guys. It cannot hurt anything.  Remember, the vast majority of libs want more control over us, more restrictions, more interference, more involuntary wealth redistribution, more taxes, more laws, more cops, etc.  The problem is once they get it. It will turn on them and they will be powerless to do anything about it.
&gt; Eliminate private funding. All campaigns should be publicly financed so that all ideas have equal platforms.  Freedom of speech is a negative right, not a positive one  but leaving that aside, lets say we enact that plan  Can i, not a candidate, but an individual make an ad saying *"write to your congressman or woman about climate change, the time to act is now!"*  Can i buy an ad in my local newspaper that says  *"Support politicians who support a womans right to chose"*  Can i make an ad and advertise it on reddit that says:  *"We need change, bernie sanders is the president for now"*  If you have noticed, all i have been doing is expressing my free speech: should i be allowed to express my free speech
No one is.
The fact this post has 800 upvotes and less than 50 comments says something. People are just upvoting anything with Bernie's name. Inb4 downvotes
*Sanders's 
Shit like this reads just like the lead up to Obama's first term. Do people actually believe he is going to be any different? Politicians will say anything to get elected, and look at how many "guarantees" Obama made and people hyped that just weren't followed through.  Honest question.
I don't see how it's interesting or notable that gvt builds and operates roads.  I guess this would be a counterexample to the extreme libertarian view that everything should be privately owned, but most people are fine with the gvt funding some public goods.
even bill maher shrugged sanders off like some old nut job socialist. If anything, I thought maher would be a supporter. Boy was I wrong
I will not let the government control me of fear of one party to vote for a person that I do not believe in. If Hillary wins then so be it. I'm just one vote though, I won't sway an election.
So if I am reading this right.. My income would be taxed, putting money in my 401k would be taxed, and then taxed again when I pull it back out?
So they should remove a Republican and put an independent in their place.

Didn't downvote because of wetblanket, down voted because you can easily look at Bernie Sanders record yourself and see why we believe in him. He has 25 years worth of voting for the things he's saying he supports.
&gt; They gave the lower classes enough rights to the point that they wouldn't rebel and seize the rich's property, but not enough to give them any substantial political power.  The right to bear arms isnt "substantial"?  Many of the founding fathers wrote personally its intent was to provide a way for citizenry to rebel against the government - something most governments wouldn't dream of granting to civilians.  And even that isn't a correct way to frame, say, the Bill of Rights.  The bill was designed not to grant rights to citizens, but to prevent the government from taking said rights.    American citizens (and yes, I realize how limiting that was at the time) had a damn good deal of rights - more than almost anyone in any western nation at the time.  
Businesses will have to let people go. This is going to result in the loss of a lot of jobs. Minimum wage jobs are usually minimum skill, which is already being replaced by robotic technology. Basically everyone who already makes less than 15 an hour is having their job put on the line. Not to mention, prices will rise to even out the wage increase. 
He's not crazy or stupid, he just has no integrity and is willing to say anything to pander to crazy and/or stupid people.   That might be worse.
&gt; Honestly, I'm not sure why you are suggesting it hurts the very poor versus helping the moderately poor. Can you explain this point more?  So unless you disagree with the basic economic theories/principles, you'll understand that firms hire/fire until marginal benefit equals marginal cost. So a worker who has a marginal benefit to their employer less than the price floor (minimum wage) will not hired. This worker is the "very poor".  Keep in mind you may have two identical workers with equal skills/experience/etc that have two different marginal benefits to their employer. E.g. it's awesome to have one janitor at this business, but two janitors is overkill and they're cleaning is very redundant. In this example, the 1st identical janitor has a much higher marginal benefit than the 2nd.   Who this helps is the union or skilled worker. They have more skills, experience, or job security (unions) so that their marginal benefit is higher than minimum wage, so they keep their jobs. These are your "moderately" poor who benefit from minimum wage.

Are you kidding? Obama is the farther left than any Democratic president in modern history, and you're still not happy. How about Dodd-Frank and the financial consumer protection Bureau? How about the Affordable Care Act? How about opening up embryonic steam cell research? How about ending the Iraq war? How about taking on predatory lending with pay day lenders? How about raising the minimum wage? What else do you need to be satisfied? You're never going to have a president with whom you agree 100% of the time. That doesn't mean you should ignore all the positive things they've done. 
We have to stop being negative. If we keep saying that he doesn't have a chance, he really won't have a chance.
And soon the textbooks those bible-thumpping asshats want (ones with no science, logic or reasoning) will be the only textbooks available to public schools there - and thereafter in most states.  
I agree but isn't it crony capitalism that is the problem? Don't you believe such a thing as crony socialism exists too? When people attack capitalism generally I immediately get worried. Will I work for nothing? Are my wages not paid with capital? Can I save my wages?   
Maybe because debating the merits of a Clinton or a Bush bores people to sleep. 
I was around for the Clinton years, I remember all of her bullshit from back then and there is no way in hell that I would vote for her. Clintons are the reason Republicans got a big surge back in the day, they produced Republicans every time they opened their mouths.   It's not like people suddenly thought Republicans were all that and a bag of chips, it was the fact they weren't associated with the complete big batch of bullshit that was the Clintons.   This is evil 1%ers doubling down on controlling both sides of the political coin by putting her up with the damned main stream media in the pockets of the 1%. pushing her like a bulldozer.   As much as I loathe to death Republicans there is no way I will sully myself voting for her. If she gets the ticket, and Republicans field a moderate or even slightly coherent candidate, I will just vote across the board Republican out of sheer spite. If Republicans field a lunatic, I will probably vote for some random third Party or just not vote at all.   These idiot limousine liberals that control the Democratic party need to realize there is going to be a palace revolt if they try to shove this wicked old evil good old boy shill down our throats. 
Obama was a dark horse doesn't mean we can't do it again.
None of those questions are anything but trolling attempts. I am not the Texas Governor. Maybe you should take some time looking into the things that he is saying, and why he chose to do this instead of just circle-jerking about how dumb you think Texas is. You are less than useless in this discussion.
As a merchant mariner I both love and hate you.   Thank you for your service and tell the NMC to get their shit together
minimum wage is supposed to be the lowest livable wage. you need 3 of these at the current rate to live.
This is why I love that Bernie ran as Democrat. It almost shows how "there are no two parties, they're the same" is close to true. I hope that Bernie exposes everyone to the corrupt political machine and maybe then people will realize that we do need the change we've been waiting for for 8 years. 
OBAAAMMAAAAA WOOOOOOOO
As a Harvard legacy, a crimson degree does not mean your smart.  Some people are allowed opportunities,  not given to others.  It's called, privilege.
Ah so this is Reddit's new version of Ron Paul. I look forward to another 12 months of this :/
Hopefully.    I'd love to see it happen but even if he doesn't win, I applaud Sanders for running.  Regardless of the results, Sanders is going to make the race better just by running.
Nah. He's white and a Jew with plenty of time on the Hill. He also isn't a bag man like Obama. 
i was getting paid for skilled labor at 14 almost 15 dollars. If i didnt have a car to pay for I would be OK. but i couldnt live in the area i was working. the average rent was half my salary.
No for 100,000 it's 3,000 dollars if taxed at 0.03  Edit disregard forgot it's percent so yes it is 30 dollars
Never see him CNN, just the regular Malaysia airlines/Balitmore everyday

$30 / $1000
So Bernie Sanders is the new Ron Paul around here.

I think the major problem with it is the market would shit a brick if it was ever implemented. Like it or not, the HFT shops provide a majority of the liquidity and if they start falling out because of this, I could see the market falling double digit percents which is going to also hurt your average Joe quite a bit. It would actually help my business but I still think it's an awful idea.

That stuff about Nader was Democratic Party spin. More Dems voted for Bush than voted for Nader. Also, exit polls showed that his voters were 1/3 Republican, 1/3 Democrat, and 1/3 independent.
That's more fair.  So what's the conservative solution, and does it involve one of the following:  * Religion * Guns * Tax cuts  
Hillary's donors are mostly individuals (who work for those companies). Bernie's are almost all PACs. Is that really that much better?
Hillary is basically a moderate Democrat who is trying to cater towards Republican interests to get votes. I don't really believe she'll be an effective leader, nor will she serve the common interest.
Great, a tax hike for me.
My kind of book! Thanks so much for the pointer and your support.  &gt; This book is based on two assumptions of ours. One, it seems to us, is indisputable; the other, highly questionable. We refer to the beliefs that (a) in general, the survival of our society is threatened by an increasing number of unprecedented and, to date, insoluble problems; and (b) that something can be done to improve the situation. **If you do not know which of these is  indisputable and which questionable, you have just finished reading this book.**
Whoever wins the Democrat primary will be the next President.
You mean to tell me that *every single piece* of Republican legislation over the past 100 years has been to grow the size of government?  Surely you don't believe that. I think your "pure facts" might be a bit, well, impure.

Looks like it will be Stein again. She's a good candidate. I voted for her in 2012.
Why should we concern ourselves with which traits are electable? Why not, instead, concern ourselves with making desirable traits electable?
Only ONE candidate has a record that clearly has the people of this country in mind = Bernie Sanders. Clinton is the same old "good cop" role that leads to corporate control over people. "bad cop" republicans don't stand a chance because if they win then people won't have a chance.
Was that really a 'joke'? It came off more to me like Scalia was seriously agreeing with the man screaming about gay marriage being an 'abomination'.

Actually its quite easy to get on the ballot. It's not easy to win.
I think using drugs is a health issue, but the way we treat users in the justice system is absolutely a civil rights issue.
Don't you know? He is of the academy of Googled articles. We are not worthy 
I'm saying that inflation isn't the issue here. I'm not saying there aren't costs of increasing the minimum wage. And it may not be desirable. But these claims of 'inflation' are simply wrong. It's a confusion between costs and inflation.   I'm not throwing anyone under the bus because I'm not advocating a position in this thread. I'm pointing out how OPs claim of inflation is flatly wrong.   The poor may indeed consume more of their income on fast food. But it's also not the largest factor and the increase in wages may or may not make up for this. Most estimates seem to suggest that the effect on costs and employment are small relative to the income gains.   Yes, a competitive firm will hire less workers if th minimum wage increases. But the relevant issue is how elastic this demand is. Most estimates indicate it's quite small, between -.1 to zero!  That means a 10% increase in wages decreases employment in those industries by just 1%.  Overall wages earned increases (total wages paid). 
Nor should they. If you can't figure out how to get past a minimum wage job, are you who we want reproducing and raising America's next generation?
&gt; getting tougher is definitely the answer.   It is for the war profiteers. 
Biases against socialism; we've been conditioned to have a knee-jerk aversion to it.
I think that not one single Republican-controlled Congress has shrunk or reduced the size of government in 100 years. If you DON'T think that's a fact you might want to study history.  Reducing the size of one or two small government expenditures while mindlessly ballooning the DoD budget is NOT small government. It's idiocy, both on their part and on the part of anyone who voted for them because of their "small government stances". 
Exactly, most people accept some socialism. They've been conditioned to have a knee-jerk aversion to it while accepting it on one level or another.
Im voting her if it comes down to that but I'm campaigning for and voting Bernie in the primaries. I'm pretty sure he's pro choice too
[Oh, well in that case](http://i.imgur.com/TemwQI5.gifv)  His other comments make him out to be a real peach. /s*
For sure! There's much more that unites us than divides us. We may just have to open up our idea of what "society" is in the passage you quoted. It's not Democrats and Republicans, or Americans and foreigners. It's sentient beings and the planet we are stewards of.
Voting Green would split the Democratic Party, again.   I'd rather have Hillary in office than one of the modern age republicans. 
That's not true. Independents really have an uphill battle getting on tickets in a lot of places. Every state has their own rules, and some of them are pretty unreasonable. I know about this because I volunteered for the Nader campaign in 2004. He didn't have the backing of the Green Party that year, so he was running as an independent, and it was a nightmare for him to get on enough ballots to even theoretically have a shot at winning. On top of that, the Democrats were sending out mobs of lawyers to try to find some technicality to get him kicked off the ballots. Having a political party behind you is a *huge* advantage.
I wish I was. Look into his political history.
Sans the racism and fake eyebrows..
Neither does Bernie. Having 8 front page articles about Bernie Sanders is completely ludicrous. /r/Politics has lost its damn mind.
That's because your idea is incredibly stupid. There are proposals in place for the development of renewable energy sources and the phasing out of the use of nonrenewable energy sources.   You're about to say all the renewable energy sources aren't feasible on the scale we need. Don't bother saying it. I already know from your post that you aren't open to the idea.
lol duh? The point is that a group of people on the interwebs are getting really excited about a fringe candidate with no chance at winning. We don't need 5 articles about bernie sanders every damn day.
As an independent he would split the democratic vote and almost assure a republican victory, so FOX NEWS would do what they could to attack Hillary more in the primaries and may even run softball pieces about Sanders to seem "fair and balanced."
Sanders is more liberal than Obama meaning that even less of what he proposes will actually be considered by congress if he's president (and Obama at least had a few years of a blue house and senate)  Sanders can't just rule the country by fiat even though that's what reddit wants.  Also Sanders is polling 50 point behind Hillary so it's not going to happen anyway no matter how much money reddit wastes on this guy
Yeah, that's exactly what would happen in my opinion. 
Hillary sucks balls. Even if you know nothing else about her, just look at who funds her. 
I'm not arguing any of that just that people have quickly forgotten the  devastating financial impact to the US economy from the events of that day.  I'm sure lots of people profited from it but I would also say that more was lost than ever gained.
No, but the party seems like it may have collectively learned a lesson during the last presidential election. 
Yeah it was proposed on purpose.   &gt;The Democrats pushed for the climate change votes as an attempt to get Republicans on the record in advance of the 2016 elections, with polls showing that a majority of Americans believe humans are causing global warming. The votes were offered as non-binding amendments to the bill authorizing construction of Keystone.  Basically Dems know NASA, the scientific community, as well as most major corporations in America all believe climate change is man made so they GOP is just shooting themselves in the foot. 
Ah, yes. Never underestimate the democratic party's ability to cut off its nose to spite its face.
Park them in Arizona, won't cost nearly as much.
Student debt topped $1.2 Trillion last year.  Hmm, what to do with all the F-35 spending. . . .
there's nothing wrong with any of those things. The issue is when elected officials owe favours to the people who funnel cash in to their campaign. There's a lot more than just buying ads. You need transport, you need to hire people to run the campaign, you need to buy yourself screen time.
Why would you start a family while on minimum wage? 
If a big man has his foot on the throat of a little one you most certainly can help by knocking him on his ass. 
The smear campaign has begun ladies and gentlemen.
Til you get in an accident that is out of your control... Or something else. There are a lot of variables that you cannot control. That is what insurance is for. But I feel you. 
&gt; that the Senate turned down  Exactly. Who cares what someone puts forth? ANY politician can put forth legislation to make themselves look good.  I cannot tell you how little I care about what someone's intentions.  Sanders has a lot of intentions, but he's terrible at actually getting people to follow his lead.
Because we are talking about elections and electable traits. They are tied very closely. The only reason socialism has negative connotations is because those with money are willing to spend it to convince us that socialism is bad. Most people don't have any idea what socialism actually entails.  Essentially, socialism is only considered a bad thing because people spend money to advertise that it is a bad thing. Otherwise, people wouldn't care in the same way they wouldn't care if you were a Republican or a Democrat.
If he finds a tall glass of ignorant bigotry "refreshing", I wonder if he's ever tried lemonade...
no context
Public goods aren't socialism. Socialism is gvt ownership of private goods.
Do prices REALLY have to go up, though?  I mean, really?  The Walton family heirs would just have to raise the price of everything in their store to survive that hit that would come from having to pay their fucking employees even a dollar more than min wage?  I mean, what with that $20 billion fortune they each have for not a day of work in their lives and all.

We dont realize it but minimum wages are going to get struck down if Fast Track passes, because of trade in services agreement. (TISA) being merged into WTO-GATS.  It will be framed as a "technical barrier to entry" for foreign firms who would become entitled to do jobs because of their low bids. That is why they are creating a "healthcare crisis" and an "education crisis" Its all a scheme to get us to agree to massive globalization of labor. Google the phrase "the fourth mode of supply"
I have zero problem with that. They're making money out of thin air by executing trades a few nanoseconds faster than competition... and they want to complain about a tax hike? First off, computer programs are made to execute those trades, so it's not like it's even employing anyone. Second, it's wheel spinning. They're not generating production, or jobs, or even contributing to our society... they're just adding numbers to their bank accounts, which then get spent protecting their infinite-income machine.  For anyone wondering how is works: There are datacenters the likes of Facebook and Google in the NYC area that are equipped with multiple fiber-optic links to exchanges and other companies. I work in a similar one, and they're hidden in plain sight: A floor in a skyscrapers, a renovated warehouse, random office park suite, etc. By executing trades on-the-nanosecond (something only possible with the latest in processing capability and internet connectivity) large financial institutions can make money doing advantageous trades, selling and buying where the difference is fractions of a point, and they do it in such high volume that it's profitable. Literally making money from nothing.  Think of it like Office Space and Sneakers. Take a little bit of money from a large amount of transactions, a few fractions of a cent (rounding errors to most people) and add it up. It's illegal for you and me, but the way they're doing it is legal, and considered normal operations.
Look, Clintons make me politically active back in the day. Their bullshit prompted me to vote for Bush and I did so twice. Yeah...lol..not too proud of it, but I own it.   By the time Bush got out, I didn't vote the next election. I was so disgusted I didn't care who the Democrats ran, I just wanted to punish Republicans. They could have ran a cartoon character for all I knew.   I voted for Obama in his second term because Republicans soiled themselves horribly by acting so dishonorably after he got elected. They put their interests and the interests of their puppet masters above the interests of the country.   There used to be a modicom of honor in the system that if you lost the election, your side STFU to a degree and just worked to put forth good ideas and to make the system work. Republicans pissed away all of that and went full traitor full retard and did damage to the country out of spite and the hopes of having something to lie about come next elections.   That puts them in the "evil no good sons of bitches" category and puts me in the big tent of freak shows known as the Democrats. No I don't like everything in the Democratic party, but due to the Republicans goose stepping so far to the Right that I need the Hubble Telescope to find them, by geometry I'm now on the left.    It's a two party system, like it or lump it. Pick the side you can stomach the easiest and do your best to clean it up. This is why I'm as much of a pro Bernie as I am a fuck Hillary kind of guy as I can be. 
Yes anyone could, but who else did? What has Hillary accomplished?
Same here. I'm a republican and I like Bernie. Just wish he'd be pro-life and against gay marriage. 
HILLARY CLINTON: America, don't fuck this up for me.
Well, I will tell you that you may not like Hillary's ties to everything, but that also gives her a lot of power to get things done once she gets there. So maybe she isn't perfect, but she has much more power to get things done than Sanders will. Not that I'm a big fan of Hillary, you understand.  The point of all this is that we're not electing a king that can make proclamations. 
Is anyone else bothered by the fact that this article doesn't explain the exercise Ted Cruz is talking about? I'm not claiming cover-up or conspiracy, i'm claiming poor writing. It blows past the name of the operation and the supposed conspiracy so quickly it reads as more of a hit piece, which is probably why so many politicians claim the media is out to get them.  Also, here's an article that explains Jade Helm: http://www.chron.com/news/article/Covert-warfare-comming-to-Texas-6157685.php
&gt; If I run a business and I need a task done that requires 8 people, I'll hire 8 people to do it. If the cost of labor is halved, would I then hire 16 people for the sheer fuck of it? No, I'd hire 8. And if the cost of labor doubled, would the task miraculously only need 4 people? No, it would still need 8. So I'd hire 8.  This isn't how businesses always work. It's not a linear equation. You say you need 8 to do the job. How much faster/more efficiently could you do it with 9? That's the marginal benefit/cost: doing a certain task with X people vs X+1 people.  Certainly some firms/jobs will completely, 100% inelastic (what you've described). However, there are many, many jobs/markets where this logic does not apply. Janitors are a great example.  &gt;If a worker becomes an expense and you decide to boot him because of it, you also lose the customers he would have served.   Correct. And in the given example you would want to lose those customers because you are losing money serving them.  &gt;Customers who would buy more than just the surprisingly low-margin burgers  You're now manipulating the example to screw up the illustration. If you want to argue that, assume the 10 cents profits per burger included all the drinks/etc that customers also buy.  &gt;In the real world it's more fuzzy than that. In fact, many employees are strictly an expense. ie, everybody in management.  No one is saying it's easy to measure. But don't confuse a direct benefit with the true economic benefit. Sure management doesn't build/deliver the good/service, but that doesn't mean they don't have a marginal benefit to the company. An employee who is strictly an expense (nothing to do with revenue) might reduce other costs in excess of their salary. That doesn't mean he doesn't have a marginal benefit.  
The questions in this interview were great. Did you see the video at the bottom? This is the kind of thing people should see to learn about [him.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/politics/bernie-sanders-in-his-own-words/2015/04/29/03877bda-eeb8-11e4-8050-839e9234b303_video.html)    The nice part is, his voting record *actually* matches what he says in interviews. 
unions are people now...  Please don't open that can of worms.
also, while they do donate ungodly amounts of money to superPACs, the Koch brothers are still limited by the $2,600 limit as far as direct donations go. 
On medical marijuana:  &gt; "I don't think we've done enough research yet. Although I think for people who are in extreme medical conditions and have anecdotal evidence that it works, there should be availability under appropriate circumstances. But I do think we need more research, because we don't know how it interacts with other drugs. There's a lot we don't know."  That doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  If she's in favor of having it researched, and not fighting legalization, that's not an issue.  She supports the states doing what they want about it, and if she lifted the research restrictions that would be great.  There's a lot of shortcomings with Hillary already, I don't think we need to artificially manufacture outrage.
I voted for Nader in 2000, and I don't regret my vote one bit.  However, if Nader ran as a Democrat, he could have gained much more support.  His inclusion in the debates would have meant his progressive message would have reached many more people, not just liberal Democrats like me, and even if Gore won the primary, George W. Bush probably would not have become president.  [Our winner take all electoral process is fundamentally flawed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).  It forces us unto a two party system.  That's the unfortunate reality of politics in the USA.  There cannot be a viable third party, the only thing that is possible is for another party to replace one of the established parties. 
So someone should be paid more based simply on their condition...?
The carbon cycle regulates the energy balance for the planet. We are throwing that way off by releasing excess co2 and causing something called radiative forcing to increase. We are throwing off the energy budget for the planet, and it will respond. 
He may have been able to easily afford the tuition, but that doesn't take away from the degree he earned.
Sounds like all the same shit Obama said, too. Hope. Change. 2008. Rock the vote.
Yes, it could happen but it likely won't. Sanders is highly unlikely to win the nomination in the first place, but one could if he did win see him put Clinton in as VP. However, Clinton would likely want a centrist rather than a far-left as VP because once one is in the general election one generally wants to move to the center. 
Considering it is easier to get your hands on pot than alcohol for people under 21 I fail to see your point.  Your point is basically that since it can't be a 100% fix we should abandon it entirely despite the fact that any negatives exist already but are actually higher than they would be if we changed our views.
Kind of sounds like that's what she is hinting at with the "research needed", but yeah, saying it would be big and a safe move.  
Agreed. I think they (Republicans) will fail to address any of those things and double down, and will eat themselves alive in the primary.  That is why I feel now is the best time to push for a true left candidate, as we really have nothing to lose to try.
Its only earned by 4% of workers, half of which are kids, its not really supposed to drspit what old Bernie might tell you about the 50s
now we're just talking about two different things.  you're talking about a presidential election and i'm talking about the structure of the legislative system.  I agree that the electoral college could be improved upon.  I think a system where each state splits their electoral votes based on the percent of votes a candidate received in that state would be more fair.  However it's only more fair if every state switches to that system at once.  If only a couple states switched it could really skew elections in one party's favor
Agreed. The money that goes into software development in those companies is huge. For some of these companies, CS's straight out of college are being payed over six figures.   If you're the head of a team you might see a significant increase in your pay. On the flip side, if anything goes wrong you will be working until its fixed.
Could there be any stronger reason to oppose this TPP thing?
&gt; Sanders labels himself a socialist and will shed light on what that actually means in debates  " social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy"  Cuss word or not, I don't see how that is a good idea. I quite like the barber down the street being able to own his own shop.
I would like to see sources on these numbers. I have a very hard time believing Medicare has overhead costs of 3-4%.
It may make you feel good to support Sen. Sanders, but in reality he will never be elected president.  He most likely won't even be the democrat nominee.  What he will do is move Hillary to the left to pander to that faction.  Democrats campaign to the left and govern closer to the middle, republicans campaign to the right and also govern more to the middle.  Even on the outside chance he was elected, it would take way longer than the possible 8 years he could serve to swing 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate to approve any of his visions.  In the time he has been in congress he has had 3 bills signed into law: 1 dealing with the cost of living for veterans and the other 2 were re-naming post offices.  Not a powerhouse resume.  All of his current sponsored bills have anywhere from a 9% to 0% chance of passing.  Again, he is out of touch with America.  https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=400357  I do find it amusing that he is being given this much attention.  A democrat socialist in his mid 70's with an ideology from the '60's trying to lead in the 21st century.  I see this as someone who is trying to lead while looking in the rear view mirror.  Hillary is no different.  To me being progressive is looking ahead, not relying on failed policies from the "New Deal" or "War on Poverty".  Billions, probably trillions spent on these with minimal results.  Knowing all of this, I support him for the democrat nomination.  That will all but ensure a republican victory.
they are obvIivious to the needs of their constituents and too fucking stupid to write their own bills...rent a legislature!
Ah, that old conservative gem: 'The poor shouldn't have families!'.  Fuck off.
&gt;  It's very easy to get a staffing agency like ManPower or Robert Half to bring in a dozen contractors for a 4-6mo 1099 contract job, make the program more efficient, then cut them loose.  That's not how it works. It is a *continual* process of improvement, as the properties of the market that HFT takes advantage of change *all the time* in non-predictable ways on very short timescales. HFT employs huge numbers of software people. They HAVE to. They don't have a business if they don't.  HFT software isn't like other software. HFT firms don't make money by selling software; they don't have releases spaced months or more apart. HFT software is *how they make their money*.
The current proposed solutions are take from the "middle" class to give to the poor. That's why people are against these ideas. There is no way in America for a politician to say they'll give to the poor and take from the rich, its just not believable.  And don't believe Bernie if he says it, he has more control over this now than he would if he was president.
The Teamsters have about 1.2 million members. Citigroup has about 240,000 employees and has donated almost ten times as much money. Cut the bullshit
Those are actually individual people donating to Clinton, while Sanders collects his money from political action committees.   But that doesn't fit the narrative of people who keep posting that chart without understanding what it means. 
Well that settles it then, the Senate has spoken.
&gt;Public goods aren't socialism.  Stop equivocating, please.  I'm not talking about public goods, I'm talking about the means of production.  If you want to consider infrastructure a public good, knock yourself out, but that doesn't mean it isn't also a means of production that is controlled by the state.  &gt;Socialism is gvt ownership of private goods.  Socialism is public ownership of means of productions.
So? It would cost more to enforce these rules than could be saved by them (because no money would be saved). This is strictly punitive, and should not be endorsed by any sensible person.
Someone give this person gold
inequality will always be present in a capitalist society. 
Let's take all the annual income from the 1%.  [We'd get about 20% of GDP.](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0)  Bernie is talking about a welfare state along the lines of northern Europe which requires about 50% of GDP.  Where's the 30% deficit going to come from?  edit: Lots of downvotes for asking a legitimate question about his agenda.
I thought you were asking about SuperPACs, since I had referenced millionaires and billionaires in my post.   I don't think regular PACs go around the limit. The link that guy provided was lifetime contributions. If a union wants to spend money independently to support a candidate in TV ads, however, they can spend as much as they can raise from their members, I think.  I still highly recommend the article.
The problem is exactly that you're not thinking about this in terms of public goods v private goods. That's how grownups think about infrastructure and its role in the state.  Of course, if you don't want to join the grownups' discussion about this stuff, that's certainly your prerogative. 
Perhaps. But I don't believe that a single-parent should be paid more simply because they are so. I would not be opposed to government benefits for a single-parent (which there already are some).  This extends to even "two-parent" families as well for me. I would prefer government benefits rather than being paid more simply for having kids.
I've never met a Texan with an IQ above room temperature.  
corruption will always be a component of society when it is a capitalist society. 
The problem is that you're deliberately ignoring that I'm talking about means of production here; you're in essence going after a [straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).  There exists in this country infrastructure that is paid for and controlled by the public.  That means that on some level we accept socialism since [infrastructure is a means of production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production).
Oh, no worries. He swept lots of young and old people away. We just don't want to RP this guy. 
Oh is Bernie promising change? That's new and exciting.
i definitely wouldn't want that to happen either. i'm happy that i can openly support Bernie. even when i kind of supported Ron, i felt like it was difficult--to put it mildly--to tell people that i supported him. i won't have that problem with Bernie. i've already posted things related to him on Facebook, so... yea. i'll do what i can to not RP him, and bring him to the attention of those i know
Your point doesn't matter. You're not going to blow anyone's mind, because everyone already accepts that public goods can be legitimately created by the state.  You're making a very basic category error. 
Bernie taking the position he believes in is what makes me give him my vote. 
People should really stop posting this chart, given that you don't understand what it's actually saying.   Clinton received that money from **individual people** who work for those companies. Note the column at the top telling you that these are contributions from individuals. Clinton ran two Senate campaigns in New York, where people who work for banks were her constituents. She also ran a year-long national presidential campaign.   Sanders, on the other hand, gets more of his money from **political action committees** and less from individual people. He's also only ever run in tiny, inexpensive Vermont.   Open Secrets has amazing data. It's just a shame how often it gets misused to dishonestly promote an agenda. 
Praised be to Sanders, it will be different this time ™
Ah, that old liberal gem: 'Someone else will pay for it, just not me or the guy who wants it!'.   Fuck off, please.
Fair enough. I like to think I'm a pleasant guy ha ha. Besides, I like Sanders better than I ever liked Paul. Paul was just my favorite candidate at the time compared to his opponents. 
I'm not talking about public goods, I'm talking about means of production.  &gt;You're making a very basic category error.  Actually, you are.  "If you want to consider infrastructure a public good, knock yourself out, but that doesn't mean it isn't also a means of production that is controlled by the state."  You want to pretend that if you call it a public good that it necessarily means it isn't also public ownership over a means of production.
Until they are actually needed.  Then, the cost would be 10 times higher for an even shorter time period than the 55 years envisioned for aircraft that are dramatically obsolete. 
I'm talking about taxes, not expenditures.  But let's roll with it.  Cut the entire DoD and you'd get about [3.8% of GDP.](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/current_spending)  Cut all law enforcement spending and you'd get about [~1% of GDP.](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/current_spending)  You have 25% of GDP left to go.
Bernie has been running the same platform for 30 years. He voted against the first Gulf War, along with voting no for The Patriot Act and the Iraq War, at the time correctly predicting what would happen. He's been a supporter of marriage equality since 1996 and voted in favor of medical marijuana in 2001. The American people are catching up to Bernie, he's not pandering to them.

You just skipped around everything I said. Do you think it's okay for a business owner to collect extra money at the expense of his own workers? And then have the government PAY the workers because the business owner won't?  This is the thing with your argument. It's extremely vague. You give these ideas, but with no idea how they would play out. If people right now cannot survive on the minimum, how could there be less? Your "solution" would actually expand the problem. Instead of a system where everyone wins, you willingly choose a system where there are only select winners, and everyone else is a loser. Is there even a difference between what you just said and feudal Europe?
"On recreational [use], you know, states are the laboratories of democracy. We have at least two states that are experimenting with that right now. I want to wait and see what the evidence is."  That seems perfectly reasonable. 
They exist and are called credit unions. A few states have a public bank too.
Not sure of your meaning.
Whether or not he wins, I feel that just by running in the election, Bernie is going to change the course of America just because of his ideology. He may be the reason for a lot of future legislation and I'm all for that!  
If he wants to provide the same services in those countries he needs about 50% of GDP.  That's a fact.  I'm not leading the conversation by saying where he'd get them.  It's a legitimate question to ask where he's going to get those revenues.
You're not gonna win by playing the game the way it's usually played. You're not gonna outspend anyone and you're running a socialist candidate. Not a "socialist who might or might not have been born in Kenya" type of socialist, and you remember how much weight that carried, but a real, bona fide, card carrying socialist. It's already a war of ideas, a non-traditional campaign. Why would you try to water it down at this point?
It's too bad for him America is not Socialist like Cuba or Russia.
GOP setting up to steal our votes and America yawns.
"Mr Perkins suggested that the government was the last stop to fix problems"  Maybe it's just me but, when has the government ever "fixed" anything? 
Yeah! And can we force them to buy the more fatty grades of beef too? How about making them buy only the swollen boxes of muffin mix that have the moth larvae hatching in them too? Oh yeah fresh produce. Why am I buying these people fresh produce with my one cent in taxes?
Much like a Yorkie barking at a German Sheppard is an aggressive challenge.
Damn I hope he becomes president, and I'm not even American. 
&gt;The military budget. If we stop bombing brown people in the middle east for no reason, we'll have a lot more money  The populist viewpoint that the military is bloated and wasteful and that spending is higher-than-ever is definitely a little exaggerated.

Hillary?
yea, Obama was somewhat of an internet candidate, but not wholly. i'm probably one of the more politically involved people i know, and i don't really vote (which is unfortunate). i plan on getting more deeply involved in the future, it's just tough from my financial/geographical position. i think an initial step would be to make voting day a national holiday. it would give people even less of an excuse to feign ignorance. 
So.... where is the 30% deficit going to come from?  Since you aren't intellectually honest enough to answer, come back when you're ready to say "the working and middle classes."
&gt; there's nothing wrong with any of those things.  we agree  &gt;  The issue is when elected officials owe favours to the people who funnel cash in to their campaign.   and thats why freedom and democracy arent free, they have to be fought for, if we as an electorate want to be lazy and not vote for the non-corrupt candidates that on us.   Look at the chicago elections, Rahm is clearly described as one of the most corrupt politicians, but he still won, Jesse Jackson Jr., Charlie Rangle.  the list goes on, its up to us voters to vote for candidates we feel as if represent our interets
ITT: people who are paid minimum wage should be sterilized. 
Hillary is a really easy target, you just need someone with the balls to say it publicly. 
I see no difference between the two. 
I have switched my party registration from green to democrat. I have never been excited about a democrat candidate before. This is the real hope and change everybody thought we would get from Obama.
No it really isn't, if you can't afford to have kids, don't have them. It is really that simple. Kids are expensive. 
Yet somehow Texas leads the country in jobs and other metrics.
What's wrong with not having kids if you cannot afford to have kids? That is a rational position. It's a lot of responsibility having kids, and finances are a large part of it. 
You can't earn a Harvard degree by being an idiot.  Ted Cruz is anything but an idiot.
&gt; An individual has the ability to contribute more than $120,000 per election cycle if he or she spreads it around a little bit.  How?
It's only a liability if the Republicans can nominate someone who's not Bush or not crazy. Since they can't do that, then Hillary's record is not an issue because the election will go to the least crazy person on the ballot regardless of their record. 
Ok, raise it then and have cost of living go up everywhere and then we are back to square one.

I wonder what it feels like to know you'll be remembered as one of, if not *the*, most divisive Justice to sit on the Supreme Court.
This whole state is a mess. How could Crist be our only other option? :/
Wow you liberals don't understand the basic differences between a shared expense and redistribution. Paying property taxes on land I own so my town can have paved roads that I'm allowed to use is a shared expense. Redistribution (socialism) is me paying taxes to the government, the government gives it to a stranger, and my money then becomes the personal property of the stranger.  I'm not allowed to use the stuff he buys with my taxes and he thanks the government instead of taxpayer. 
1. Your entire argument is built on a false equivalence. You do not need to copy every aspect of a government in order to implement some of its rules.  2. Your [numbers are wrong.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP). It's 40%.  3. [Wealth produced per person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_hour_worked) is much higher in the US than many of those same similar countries. Even though the middle class in the US earns less on average. This means you would not need to tax the middle class as much.  You're entire argument is based on ignorance and false assumptions. Even if it wasn't, then your argument is still completely incorrect in both the basis of the argument and the conclusion.  I even [baked you a pie](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfae553ef01a3fcfbfae2970b-pi). You should have a slice.

Step 2: Knock on doors for Bernie Sanders.  Step 3: Elect Bernie Sanders.  Step 4: ???  Step 5: Billionaires don't profit.
Uhh, did you read that article?  &gt; A survey of peer reviewed scientific papers from 1965 to 1979 show that few papers predicted global cooling (7 in total). Significantly more papers (42 in total) predicted global warming (Peterson 2008). The large majority of climate research in the 1970s predicted the Earth would warm as a consequence of CO2.
But /r/politics told me that everything is conservative. Even Sanders is as conservative as Reagan! 
Oh sure, there are lots of us that aren't very smart. I'm not gonna argue against that
[deleted]
Of course she does.  Just once you take sanders out of the race, every other viable candidate sucks balls even worse.  Say what you want about democrat corruption.  It still isn't as terrible and hateful as republican corruption.
Your numbers are wrong, tax revenues are between 45-50% in Scandinavian countries in the source you cite.  Government spending is from [50% to as high as 58% in Denmark.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending)  I'm assuming Bernie actually wants to pay the bills.    The 1% takes in about 20% of GDP.  You need to get at least 30% elsewhere.  Your argument is completely incorrect and baseless.
You can contribute to multiple candidates, to political parties, etc.   Contribution Limits  An individual may give a maximum of:  $2,700 per election to a Federal candidate or the candidate's campaign committee. Notice that the limit applies separately to each election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are considered separate elections.  $5,000 per calendar year to a PAC. This limit applies to a PAC (political action committee) that supports Federal candidates. (PACs are neither party committees nor candidate committees. Some PACs are sponsored by corporations and unions--trade, industry and labor PACs. Other PACs, often ideological, do not have a corporate or labor sponsor and are therefore called nonconnected PACs.) PACs use your contributions to make their own contributions to Federal candidates and to fund other election-related activities.  $10,000 per calendar year to a State or local party committee. A State party committee shares its limits with local party committees in that state unless a local committee's independence can be demonstrated.  $33,400 per calendar year to a national party committee. This limit applies separately to a party's national committee, House campaign committee and Senate campaign committee.  $100 in currency (cash) to any political committee. (Anonymous cash contributions may not exceed $50.) Contributions exceeding $100 must be made by check, money order or other written instrument.
&gt; I'm unconvinced that those "individuals" were really individual donations at all, instead of corporate orders.  I mean sure, you can spin anything to be in your favour if you pull facts out of thin air.
Jesus Christ, this isn't satire?
The only bad thing about the free market is that the successful people eventually make it less free.  Laissez faire works, but only when you also keep the corporations from manipulating the market as well (after all, they're just a large power at this point as well).
My cousin married a man who thinks the same thing.  They are both in their 50s.   Old enough to know better, young enough to not trust fox news.   But then, this guy is a Grifter.   Don't invest in oil, it's a scam.

Just to be clear, you don't believe individual people actually contributed to Clinton's campaigns because, um, beliefs? Instead, you believe that Clinton and these companies engaged in a massively illegal campaign finance fraud that no one, besides you of course, has ever uncovered?  Sounds legit.   And Clinton has received a higher percentage of her contributions from individual donors that Sanders has. 
Why limit your statement to capitalism? Communist societies were corrupt, mercantilist societies were corrupt, feudal monarchies were corrupt.   The key is looking at the structural incentives in any system and minimizing the incentives for corruption. Can never eliminate it entirely as some people are just shady but systems can be tweaked some the incentives operate against corruption for the most part.
I'm not the guy you commented to, but I'd consider myself a "conservative." In the sense that my solutions would diverge from those of "liberals."  I want healthcare reform, I'd prefer something of a single-payer (possibly optional) "national health insurance." Not free, not welfare. But still much cheaper than the current system. With room to evolve to subsidize the poor later. This is something I think both sides could stomach somewhat sooner.  The discussion on the minimum wage...I think it's all wrong. I would prefer investment in education than anything else. Some (plenty I think) of Republicans want it this way.  Marijuana and other drugs...I think they should probably be illegal. Even if it is irrationally.  If marijuana was legal my opinion of smokers would not change (I don't really see them as criminals), I would think very little of them.  Same for smokers and drinkers too though. Nothing wrong with a cigar and a beer every now and again but...I don't know. Can't say how I feel is rational.  Homosexual marriage...I'm not necessarily comfortable with it, but I really don't care. There are far more important things to be concerned with.   On that note, #Kasich2016.

Even if they did nominate someone sane, the public will still realize that the Iraq War is still more the republicans fault than the people who voted to support it because Cheney/Dubya scared everyone with blatant lies.  Clinton's Hawkishness scares me but I remember the fear surrounding the post 9/11 era well enough that I can't blame people for being fooled.
&gt; people felt no qualms about commenting on my grocery purchases (and my morals) in the checkout line.  I'm sure you've seen [this Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/article/woman-a-leading-authority-on-what-shouldnt-be-in-p-35922). If not, you should read it.  As for the racism and sexism, I think that explains a significant part of the moral panic around "fraud". It's not a serious concern. Actually, I think the false positives (eligible people kicked off food stamps because of an error) are a bigger problem than the false negatives (mostly people who "aren't quite poor enough" getting more access to food than they "should"). But people FREAK OUT because it allows them to vent their (often subconscious) biases in a way that accords with social norms.
Most of the government is already privatized. So what are you talking about? 
Can someone explain why the senate would spend time voting on such purely-symbolic things like this? This "bill" seems to have no policy implications; it's just people voting on what opinion the majority of them share. 
The important distinction is that one group peacefully attended a sporting event.  The other group is a violent racist mob.

The contributions are broken down into two columns: individuals and PACs.   The money from individuals comes from individual people. When you make a contribution, you must disclose your employer. The individual contributions counted in these columns are from individuals who were employed by those companies. Clinton ran two Senate campaigns in New York, where individuals who work for banks were among her constituents. This is not money from corporations.   The money from PACs is from political action committees set up by corporations or unions that are funded directly by the corporation/union.   Clinton has received a lot of contributions from people who work for big companies, which is unsurprising given that she ran two expensive senate campaigns in the state where many of these companies are headquartered (and where most of their employees live) and a year-long presidential campaign.  Clinton has actually received a higher percentage of her contributions from individual donors than Sanders has. 
Quick question, where do you guys come from?  I could always tell when it was a merchant mariner on the phone because I can't understand 2/3rds of the shit they say.

Ahh the effects of the "free market economy". It's the eventual outcome of the republican's economic Darwinism, and it's very effective when the wealthy make the rules for the governance and oversight of wealth acquisition, taxes and maintenance.

&gt; Liberals have been pushing for single-payer for a long time.  Yes but a healthy amount of Republicans support it as well. And plenty more would probably go for my idea. It's ideologically conservative.  &gt;so why would you keep voting republican when they OPENLY say that want to prevent gays from marriage (and are spending a huge amount of resources to fight it)  Plenty of Republicans don't care, just like me. This will be my first Presidential election, I'll see who I vote for. But for the record, I likely would have gone, Obama 2012, Obama 2012, Bush 2004, Bush 2000.  &gt;are highly against strong public eduction as they have gutted school systems across the country?  This hasn't really proven true in my home, Ohio.  Like I said, I want Kasich to be President.
A Hillary run will electrify the right. Fox News would be ecstatic to see Hillary get the nomination. I daresay she's far more divisive than Sanders is, even among the Democratic party.
The real difference is that his following is so small that he doesn't have to try and appease that many different interests. A presidential candidate has to be able to represent 50%+ of Americans interests. A candidate like Sanders is trying to represent a majority of Americans. He's trying to represent progressivism. That kind of stance won't win him the election, but it may help foster some debate. Don't belittle all other politicians as if what Sanders is doing is noble. He has the political luxury to be able to do what he is doing because he stands no real chance of winning.

There is no probability here. The survey is bad data. What do you not get about that? There is no statistical calculation that will give you what you want on this data.  &gt; Bayes Thereom  It's Bayesian logic itself, actually, is what I was referring to. Did you already have that response loaded and ready to go no matter what I said? Updating your "priors" still gives you a probability of the next event, not a consensus, and speaking of, still relies upon having accurate data that can actually be used. As said, with each new statement you're proving you don't know anything about statistics.  &gt; And, you're failing the basics  Actually, that would be you, buddy. If you can't deal with any of the argument (as you're proving by not dealing with anything I've said), you've proven you can't deal with even basic arguments.  &gt; you'd update your priors here  What "priors"? Exactly? A consensus has always been your argument, not mine, because again, I deal with the truth behind statements, not how many people agree with it (fallacy). How long are you going to ignore that?
Socialist pickpocket Bernie Sanders after your wallet http://allenbwest.com/2014/09/socialist-pickpocket-bernie-sanders-wallet/
It's not exclusively the progressives that are getting rich. In fact, it's money in politics that is causing a lot of the issues you just mentioned.   Like I've seen stated before, a free market is only as good as its participants. And the participants here are usually selfish(not all bad) and short-sighted. 
**Because she started the Iraq war and none of them did.**  She wrote the Joint Resolution to authorize it.  Maybe she was tricked, and if so, she showed bad judgment that we don't want in our president.  Maybe she wasn't tricked...  Which is worse?  Who *else in the race* started the Iraq War besides Clinton?  Who else used to tun Walmart? If in the debates she even mentions the middle class or Walmart she will be asked what she did when she ran Walmart. No one else ran Walmart.  Is there another candidate as wealthy as she is? How did she earn any of this money? She got it from the world's wealthy elite for her "charity". (Her "charity" keeps 85% of the money for "expenses" and uses only 15% for good projects.)  Is there a Republican in the race that is so *totally owned* by the wealthy elite?  Who else started the Iraq War? Did she show good judgment in starting that war (and the Afghanistan, Somalia and Libyan War)? Has anyone else in our history ever started *four wars*?
Based on your link, primarily from the rest of the top 10% of earners, since the top 10% took in fully half of all income.  Since the bottom 40% of households received less than 15% of all before-tax income in 2011, we can assume that a pretty much negligible amount is coming from them.  That suggests an average tax rate of 60% on the top 60% of households would, by itself, exceed 50% of total income.  Of course, the bottom 60% of households only received something like 20% of the income, so the middle 20% (which received somewhere in the vicinity of 11%) could keep their total tax burden pretty much where it is now (or even a little lower) without making much difference; the difference between them being taxed at 20% and 50% is only around 3.5% of national income.
I am so relieved that someone other than Hillary is running because I think she would be a horrible president. I am a woman but still would not vote for her. It is insane that we can not find any people other than Bushes and Clintons to lead the country. There are what about 230,000,000 people in the US?!? We have had enough of Washington insiders...   Plus, doesn't anyone remember that they STOLE dishes when they left the white house. Who does that?!?
The man is just laying the law down
You dont get it, free trade is just the market.. market means market.. Even if there were no workers, market is determined by the cost of labor.. which will soon be determined by the price of electricity.  Suppose the price of doing your job suddenly becomes .00000351 cents/hour. Thats the market price. Obviously, thats good for somebody, so the agreement says that the optimal situation. Thats what we should be working for, increased value, it says.  In FTAs, the leaders/legislators of a country at a given moment in time (who may have been promised cushy low show or no show jobs as lobbyists or think tankers in perpetuity) agree to commit the future country even through changes in government - So future elections cant change anything, the commitment applies to the land, not them- to the regime, forever. The CONTRACT says they agree to conform their laws to the agreement- (the words in the "fast track" bill for example, are completely irrelevant, the FTA itself is the entire agreement.. the bills that create things like the WTO, NAFTA, CAFTA, etc, are so forgotten now you cannot even find them anywhere.. They are "advisory" only which is an inside joks.. Also, you will notice THREE FTAs are almost ready to go, not just one. And the most secretive one, TISA, is likely to be a huge huge thing for the people of this country. Because its tcould set a chain of events into motion - I think this is likely, trading a great many of the last decent paying "middle class" jobs away for trade concessions elsewhere..Many of those jobs are union jobs.   The goal is also to get rid of public services, which save huge amounts of money. Look at health care in he US.. the "lifetime distribution of health care costs" in 2000 was around $360,000 per American. Since then the amount has gone up some fairly high but difficult to calculate amount probably it is now twice that. So that would be $700,000 per each of us. Now, imagine we could save half or even two thirds of that by having a system that eliminated the middlemen and eliminated all that complexity, PLUS, instead of paying the highest prices in the world, paid global average prices BEFORE the neoliberal attack on public health care and Obama's TPP raised them 200-300% in the US. Suddenly that $700k becomes maybe $200k for each of us. thats a half million dollars a person saved for our country's future. Poof, so much changes. Suddenly, people can send their kids to college or buy a home or maybe even both. Like the people in the civilized world still do.  All of the **"Trojan Horse Clauses"** as Matthew Rimmer calls them, should be made illegal.   Especially ***"Standstill", "Rollback", "indirect expropriation"*** and the insane ***ISDS***.   The free traders are really free traitors.   Look at the stupidity of saying ALWAYS BECOMING MORE LIBERALISED - *which in this context means privatized*  never going back to the old way of compassion. Even if the whole world is automated and the only jobs that exist go to a tiny elite of those able to gain the requisite education and the rest are shuttled off to the lowlands to await the next superstorm, placated with a basic income..  For want of a nail, a kingdom is lost.   The rationale is also nuts.. We have had business for all of recorded history, and we never had this insanity..   We never had the insanity because more or less, the model worked, we weren't on the threshold of not needing the worst parts of it any more.. which is where we are now.  but the parts which gain the highest profits are also the most odious.. The taking of always more and more money for medicines that cost less and less each year to make.  http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html
Nah. They'll do the same thing they did with Obama. Let him go through the elections with people actually thinking he can change what he claims.  Then he gets taken into the back room and told what's really going to happen. Publicly he's still to push soime of his agenda to save face. Some will get let through, and they work hard at scapegoats for the rest. Lather rinse repeat.

wow r/politics is getting pretty bad... the Sanders circle jerk has gone off the deep end
I remembered us going back and forth a couple of times before, so I was reading some of your other posts, and I just wanted to commend you in your defenses of market economies when you're talking to some of the lefties around here who don't get it. Nobody innovates if you remove the rewards.   So I'd like to amend my earlier statement... There are two groups of people who should be ignored when we're discussing how to create the most amount of total economic growth. People who don't understand that removing the incentives to innovate kills innovation, and people who are against innovation because they don't want competition.
No, I expect you to read the article, where they inform you that the law is incorporating federal guidelines from the WIC program - and that's where the 'shellfish' stuff is outlined.  If you care to go do a little more reading, the federal WIC site will happily explain *why* it has shellfish restrictions on a program that's designed for children and nursing/pregnant mothers.  I don't have any opinion one way or another on the appropriateness of borrowing those guidelines for a general SNAP program.  But what you term 'utter bullshit' is actually 'facts'.
In about the same way that playing the lottery makes a difference.
Bernie Sanders is retarded if he thinks he is going to be the president.
Very true, very rich liberals love Bernie Sanders; people who have never worked for their money love the idea of forcing others to give theirs away. When your base consists of the ultra-wealthy and young naive/ignorant children, then it really makes you wonder... 
Shit like this is the reason I thank Allah/Jeebus every day that Reddit does not represent America because we'd be so fucked if it did. 
[deleted]
It's not nonsense to say Sanders hasn't actually done anything. He hasn't. He can say anything to make his supporters happy, but at the end of the day he has never actually done anything. Why do you think he would be any different in the White House?
I term them 'random police officers' because there's no indication that they're outliers.  If you replaced these particular six police officers with virtually any other officers in Baltimore, I'd suggest the same result would occur.  Now, if you accept this premise, then you need to accept that we're talking about a *systemic* issue rather than an issue individual malfeasance.

Hmm, the lobster industry in Wisconsin is not so strong.
&gt; Reddit Party  I like that. It would reflect the actual views of Americans more than Democrats and Republicans.
He's basically interviewing for Fox Gnus.
Unlike you I did my own maths, And don't believe everything i read(because propaganda is now legal). Using the actual numbers, it turns out to be closer to 20% of GDP
&gt;  You will see in the next year the issues of budget shortfalls  Will we?  Too busy to answer the rest now.
Yes he has a long list of things he supported, which all look nice for someone with ambitions to run for president... but he has never actually accomplished anything. He has never took lead on a bill that actually got passed. For someone in congress as long as him, that's a pretty shitty record. It's clear that he does a good job of making his positions known. But he has no history of working with other politicians to try and actually get something done. That's pretty worrisome for someone who wants to be president.
[Indiania's way ahead of you there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill)
I wish there was a way to have reddit exclude any post with Bernie Sanders in it. This circle jerk is becoming a complete joke. 
Ha polls good one
It don't even matter, Hillary already won the primary.  It's just a formality at this point.  Bernie sanders is a non issue.  I don't know if Reddit sold him some slots, or it was some sort of vote manipulation and fake commenting, but Bernie Sanders ain't shit and everybody knows  it.
&gt;If operation [Jade Helm is preparations for an illegal immigrant hoard in the event of Earth changes](http://zetatalk.com/ning/04ap2015.htm) such as a sinking Caribbean Plate, how do the Wal-Mart closures relate? Wal-Mart is suddenly and oddly closing stores across many of the same states where operation Jade Helm will operate – California, Texas, and Florida.  Operation Jade Helm will be in operation across the southwest, and has recently expanded to include the Gulf states.  The nexus seems obvious to conspiracy theorists, who imagine that martial law and the imprisonment of citizens is being planned.  &gt;The Wal-Mart stores are being closed to be fitted as temporary FEMA centers in the event of a New Madrid disaster. The New Madrid adjustments would occur first, per our predictions, along the soft rock from Memphis to the Gulf, and thus Texas and Oklahoma are seen as safe refugee camps for that area. We, the Zetas have also predicted that a West Coast adjustment will follow the New Madrid adjustments, and California would logically be the first to adjust along the San Andreas. The US government has been monitoring the rock tension and earthquake patterns, though they do not share this with their public.  &gt;Is there some reason that Jade Helm and the Wal-Mart retrofit overlap each other? Indeed there is, in that the 7 of 10 plate movements anticipated to adjust the New Madrid will not occur unless the 7 of 10 plate movements causing the Caribbean to sink also occur. In fact, per the schedule we have provided, the Caribbean disasters would occur before the New Madrid disasters, triggering the New Madrid disasters by a movement to the west by Mexico. These disasters overlap, and thus Wal-Mart is being asked by FEMA to expedite their readiness at this time.      --**ZetaTalk** Chat Q&amp;A for April 18, 2015 | http://zetatalk.com/ning/18ap2015.htm
Oh come on. He was commenting on how out of place an outburst like that is in a room with such a serious demeanor. The author is looking way too far in to this 
Well, if wages kept pace with productivity, that's where they'd be.  Personally I don't think that's all too bad of a number.  Considering how many places refuse to give over 30 hours to their employees, that's just over $30k/year.  Taking into account the current prices of goods and services, I'd say that's a fair number to be considered the minimum a person should be making, if they're working.
What's really going on, is that the others are working within the system we have, while bernie is operating hopelessly around the outside of it...   It's not that I disagree with all of bernie's views... but when it comes to elections, it's important to be realistic, and bernie stands no realistic chance of winning the nomination, let alone the general election.
Im sorry but I don't agree.  The world is designed to generate as much income for those who designed that way.  Ive noticed in my life, that often times those who charge top dollar for their services often want the best deal possible in return for others' services.  I believe that is the problem with the economy.  If everyone were paid and paid a fair price for whatever goods or service they are purchasing, then there would most likely be a much better distribution of income. 
It shouldn't.  But you should have enough responsibility (including financial means) to take care of your offspring before having them.
See, the difference is that I'm willing to stand by my ideals even if it means watching the country burn, which at this point may not be that bad.  
No.  In all sorts of industries, where low-wage industries have been a minority percentage (and a *declining* minority percentage) for at least the past 18 months or so.
I long for the good old days when scientists would STFU until they had their ducks in a row instead of the debacle we have now where they opinionate in whatever way that will get them more money.  Sad day for science when the U.S. Senate is right and the supposed "scientific" community is wrong.
Yeah what don't you agree with him about?

Denmark hits 60, the others are 30-40, right about where we are.
Because we are not a Scandinavian country, there is nothing you could do there that you cannot achieve at a greater level in America 
As also a member of the middle class, I would prefer to keep more of what I earn, and distribute to charities and programs I see fit.  If I choose none, so be it.  There are already safety nets in place for the poor and indigent, not to mention infastructure and every other program that makes us a first world nation.  To have more of my property allocated to programs I may not agree with or that are unessesary, particularly social programs, is unacceptable.  There are ways to do it besides raising taxes.

Top rate is 39.6. We have significant state level tax, so top rate hits 48% in some places.  That's higher than most scandanavian countries.
Your assertion that it would just go away is detached from any factual evidence that you're right. People still get alcohol poisoning all the time.
Lol. What a shit article. 
He is so amazing.  He knows how Socialism works and he knows how to run Government so everyone is equal.  and I think he'll take steps to save some of our female and non-white citizens from the brutal machine that is Capitalism.    He will have a huge fight agaist the the machine during the election, but if he wins, *all* people win, not just the same old white men.
Oh good, they're pandering to the insane conspiracy theorists now. There's no way that'll ever backfire spectacularly. No sir. 
That's like saying thieves work hard for their money.
Let's just stop pretending that Scalia is up to the task of being a Supreme Court Justice. He's clearly a partisan hack and makes no excuses for it. This behavior is entirely expected of him and pointing it out is a base grab for ratings. 
You can say a lot about what Obama has or hasn't done, but honestly, I don't think anyone can say that he has shrunk from his responsibility. He wakes up and does a job literally no one else on the planet can do, everyday.  You don't have to like the job, don't have to like the quality of it, but at least give the man the credit for doing it.
Can we get /r/EnoughSandersSpam up like we did with Ron Paul?  Or maybe a filter to get remove everything that has "Bernie" or "Sanders" in the title?  This is ridiculous.  
The fact that it was believed necessary at the time is completely meaningless. 
You need to be anti-zionisst, anti militarist, not just anti billionaire to change America. 
She was fired for her incompetency, how is that successful?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to share one of Bernie's first big interviews (Minus the NBC one, but not too many people watch that show) with /r/politics

Yeah sucks how expensive clothing is these days because of how much we subsidize cotton or how much we have to pay for roads, schools and police and fire fighting services. /s
That's why I think it's so important that someone like Bernie Sanders is running, as he is the one politician who does the job he was elected to do and not just push problems around until the next election.
Oh stop the bs.  It is not the unions it is the civil leaders and the MSM in this nation that turned the police into the mass oppression tool.

minimum wage is not supposed to be a livable wage, its supposed to be a starting point.. and by working hard you can get ahead of min wage pretty easily.. im 30YO and run my own business now, however when i worked in college i started at min wage, after 3 years i was making 3.50 more an hour  than when i started min wage at the time was 6.25 in my state.. i was at 9.75 when i quit for bigger and better things 3 years later.. ( i was working at MCDS).. it wasnt ideal, but i was a rookie, and didnt have any experience in anything , so i took the job and worked hard.. Its not that difficult to make more than min wage..
You mean all those manufactured scandals that they could never make stick?
Your cotton analogy doesn't make sense.  The rest of that stuff is way overpriced.  And see healthcare and higher education.
She made herself very wealthy while destroying the company she ran. That's "success".
We are hardly laissez faire... our government creates special classes of people called "investors" that grant special types of citizens called "corporations" all their rights. So the corporation can have political input (because it is owned by people) without having to first transfer that wealth to the investors and have them directly contribute.  This would all be fine except that these investors are not responsible for what the corporation does. When BP spills shit-tons of oils into the gulf, or another sends oil smashing into a small town in a firey plume of destruction, or land owners don't want to sell thier land to a company that is going to build a giant pipeline to bring some of the dirtiest, ecologically destructive oil from the sands of Alberta into the lungs of our youth, none of the executives or investors are held accountable. They are, at most, fined. And most recently, the government has taken a "too big to fail" stance and passed laws designed specifically to keep BP from being wholly responsible from their actions.  This isn't laissez faire at all. They are mindfully and powerfully enabling bad actors in nearly every major sector, from agriculture, to oil, to fucking Walt Disney. Anyone with a lobby gets special treatment. That isn't laissez faire.
Well, most would disagree with you.   http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;amp;article_id=1054&amp;amp;issue_id=112006  http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Career_Trends/a/Ethics-In-Law-Enforcement.htm
Part of the greatness of America is that people serve it based upon the notion that the individual has the "freedom" of determining their own level of involvement.  For many, 35% of the property to the government is enough, and it's whats mandated.. For others, they may feel they want the government to distribute more of their property based upon programs that contribute to the "greater good" (which is just a term disguised to spend more on social programs that grow govt and beauacracies) .  For the former, using their hard earned money, let's say, to contribute to churches, charities, Transgender studies, butterfly reproductive habits, etc is some thing they have the freedom to do...American exceptionalism is an idea that we lead the world in charity, aid, etc, all the while maintainining a degree of individual freedom...ironically that has been degraded the past 40 years or so.

Hmmm a socialist or a scumbag. As much as I hate socialism I would take that over a known scumbag any day. Sanders is a sanctimonious prick that loves to spend other people's money but at least he'd actually go after the top 1%. Under Hillary it would be business as usual...just like Obama and Bush..the rich get richer..the income inequality at its highest and growing. Between the two Sanders gets my vote
The US taxes the working class at about 20% between federal, state and local.  You are wrong.
Amen.    And the vast majority of people here have no idea that that's the case.
I didn't make that image, I shamelessly stole it from /r/SandersForPresident
Don't you mean the Obama administration is moving in the *left* direction? ;)
I'm sorry you don't believe empirical data-driven facts.  Ever heard of the EITC?
This is one of the most selfish things I have ever read. Edit: A sudden downvote brigade hits.
less guns, more drugs, government jobs  - bernie sanders. 
Because voters in the U.S. are too stupid to understand that you get what you pay for, and don't want to pay taxes.   What many are also too stupid and ignorant to understand is that the very wealthy elected Republicans to shift more of the taxes that are paid (far lower than in almost all other OECD countries) to the lower and middle classes. 
[This](http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ef/fe/2f8ef6df4258b1e90f6f5a3e5706/140814cops-editorial.jpg) and [this](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130419190029-66-boston-manhunt-0419-horizontal-gallery.jpg) are what I'm talking about.  Saying "hurr, FEMA camps" is worse than being ignorant, it says you can't even talk about how police should act without being called a conspiracy theorist.
And people call conservatives nut jobs. Have fun voting people into office that want more and more gun control. 
The GOP hasn't looked at the presidency because obstruction isn't as easy to accomplish as president. They can obstruct in Congress and complain that both parties are at fault. They can also do it with a little more privacy.
Sadly that's the biggest reason he won't. All those young people you see saying they don't vote because they don't have a candidate that represents them? Sanders will show us all why they really don't vote... Simple laziness and complacency.  I really wish I was proved wrong, but I know I won't be. I've already given him a donation and plan to pledge a monthly amount as well, but my main hope is that he can translate that into airtime and get people talking about some of his issues.
Ahh, Please clarify you agreeing with the pope?
Why do you hate socialism?
We need to scare the two parties enough to make them fear losing their iron grip on power in this country. That will never happen if we resign ourselves to "voting for the lesser of two evils" year after year.  We badly need election reform, but that will be the most difficult thing to pry out of our "representatives."  We need to say "give us what we want or get the fuck out of here!"
True. At what income level do you think the top bracket should start?
It doesn't matter, bro. You edited your post so as not to reflect your glaring grammatical error. I thought it was apropos that you'd make a stink about America being able to do anything the Scandinavians can only better when you fucked up grammatically.  America can't hang when it comes to being a chill nation like most of the Scandinavian can. Those folks are on a whole different level when it comes to social services and quality of living. We're nowhere near them in those regards. They're far more literate as well.
Someone started a war with Libya?  Afghanistan was started by Bush though activity was delayed 7 years until we could get Bush out of office - kind of wrecked the outcome.   Somalia was started by Bush Sr in 1992.
Bernie's spent three decades fighting for the same issues. That said:  http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm
An important part of the Scandinavian cultural/political structures is their relative monocultural populace.  This population shares a fairly unified ideology.  Is Sanders proposing an ethnic/ideological purge to make America agreeable to his Scandanavian society.
[deleted]
Except this is almost exactly like he said the Paul spam that happened around 2008 and 2012. The entire sub is being dominated by news about one person because their supporters keep spamming articles and upvoting them. There were like 5 Sanders is running for President articles when he first announced in the top 25 posts. It's beyond getting ridiculous. 
So if a female candidate agrees she had sex before marriage it is fine to label her a slut?     The headline in play here is not about the word socialism.
Do you really think going from $290 a week (7.25/hour, at 40 hours, pre-tax) to $320 a week (8/hour, at 40 hours, pre-tax) is going to lift people who are in poverty out of poverty?  You can call them replaceable all you like, but that does not change the fact that we are currently paying people to do this work. Until robots overtake everything, the people who are employed doing **any job** should not be paid poverty wages.
&gt;we don't know what your intentions are once you're in office.  Really? I'm pretty sure we all know what she stands for and what she intends. In a nutshell, more of the same exact shit that's been going on with the Oval Office since Reagan - undercutting everyone else for the continued benefit of Wall St and the banks. Probably another war and definitely more drone terrorism, too.
Ok, they can choose to do that of course, but when it inevitably does not work out we cannot ignore the fact that it was a stupid decision with consequences. I don't want to fund stupid decision making with my tax money nor have my cost of living go up as a result.

&gt; Jimmy Carter II  We'd be in a much better position if that were true.
What we have in the Nordic countries is a very small amount of overwhelmingly white people with the same religion, same language and a good GDP. (See below.)  It's kind of like saying "Why can't all of the US be like Marin County, CA or Boulder, CO?"  Because the reality is we have a HUGE, diverse country with some very tricky interplay between religions, ethnic backgrounds, economic classes and so forth and we have corporations and politicians willing to play those things against each other to divide us further for their own economic ends.  Would working towards more socialist policies be good in many areas? Sure!  But, good luck. America isn't a tiny, white suburb.  -----------------------  So let's look at these Scandinavian countries...   Denmark, population 5 million...  &gt; According to 2012 figures from Statistics Denmark, 89.6% of Denmark's population of over 5,580,516 is of Danish descent (defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship). &gt; In January 2015, 77.8%[153] of the population of Denmark were members of the Church of Denmark (Den Danske Folkekirke), the officially established church  Finland, population 5.5 million...  &gt; Approximately 4.0 million (or 73.9%[119] at the end of 2014) Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland.  No ethnicity numbers are kept for Finland, but approximately 89% of people there have a mother tongue of Finnish and we can assume the demographics are similar to Sweden.  Then we have Iceland, population of about 300,000... which is...  &gt; 93.01% Icelandic &gt; 73.8% members of the Church of Iceland.  Moving on we have Norway, population of around 5 million which is...  &gt; 86% ethnic Norwegians &gt; [with] About 75.2% of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway on 1 January 2014.  ... then finally Sweden, the big boy on the block, with almost 10 million people (haha!) which also keeps no ethnicity statistics, but...  &gt; according to Statistics Sweden around 1,921,000 (20.1%) inhabitants of Sweden were of a foreign background ... With the same definition, the most common countries of origin were Finland (2.38%), former Yugoslavia or its successing states (2.06%), Iraq (1.74%), Poland (0.91%) and Iran (0.84%). &gt; At the end of 2012, 67.5% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden (Lutheran);  So Sweden, too, is overwhelmingly the same religion and the vast majority are white, just like every other Scandinavian country.
No, the problem is the political apparatus.  Get rid of everyone currently in congress and replace them all with your typical Democrat, and things still won't get any better for most people.

And here we see the face of the Authoritarian left -- that which blames the electorate for their own failures, for their tendency to peddle penny-ante bullshit social issues instead of the real economic issues people actually give a fuck about.
I think I go with the Pope on this one so that makes two of us that disagree, so some sort of argument.  
It's funny how much reddit is promoting propaganda for a guy that won't even win it. They use /r/Politics as their main propaganda platform but created /r/SandersforPresident so they can brigade two or more posts to the front page everyday. Too easy to see through, but this is reddit so I wouldn't expect people to think instead of being told to. Also notice how everyone calling it out are downvoted to silence them, basic propaganda tactics. Very basic.

When I first  read this, I figured someone had missed April 1st, then I saw that it was Texas.  It's a joke, but the joke is on the Texans who voted for him, and he's spending their tax dollars on paranoid delusions.  
Did you expect anything different from a politician from Vermont which is 95% white and less than 3% black/hispanic?
oh wow. How do I donate this to Bernies campaign? I keep throwing it at the screen but nothing happens.
The billionaires know nothing will be done to stop them. They are laughing at us right now.
I guess you can say that when you have no serious intention of winning, and just want the publicity
You hit the nail on the head.  Homogenization vs. heterogenization is something we haven't had the wherewithal to scientifically study much yet, so it's *really* hard to determine exactly what will be different about doing the same thing in a homogenized culture vs. a heterogenized culture.  We also have no idea if a well-oiled society *can actually work* long-term in an intensely heterogenized culture. We're talking about largely uncharted territory here. Hard to say exactly what will happen.
Why? Everyone seems to want everyone else to work hard, but not themselves, or their children.
Not to nitpick or anything, but he's going to be branded a socialist because he *is* a socialist. That's why he doesn't stand a chance of winning either, even though there's so much else to like about him. The American electorate doesn't go for that, not even most Democrats. Maybe 10-15% of the voters will actually agree with him on enough issues to want to vote for him in the end. 
Well I see that some Bernie Sander's supporters don't care about election fraud. That's good to know.
So a free market...only with regulations that account for positive and negative externalities....but that's not a free market. doesnt the need for the existence of these regulations kind of obviate the idea of a "free market?"
Drop alcohol for 12 months, and spend the saved money on reasonable politics?
You can achieve much higher standards of living in America. Its not guaranteed. 
Yes, in the primary election one will vote within one's party.  It is true that a lot of Democrats right now are a fan of Clinton, and Sanders will have a tough time promoting himself. 
Minimum wage jobs were never supposed to be able to support a family.  This was never the case, it isn't the case now.  There was never a time when you could support a family on minimum wage.  So right there the entire implied argument that you used to be able to but now you can't is a lie.  Secondly, these jobs that pay minimum wage were never intended to be able to support a family.  As some other posters have noted, they are disproportionately held by the very young.  Mostly these jobs are supposed to be for high school/college students getting experience and earning some extra money.  Occasionally they are entry level where you work your way up.  But never were they ever intended for you to be able to just work a minimum wage job and support a family.    Now, if you want to argue that many are forced into what were previously starter jobs because of the death of manufacturing/skilled positions, I would say two things.  1) there is a massive shortage of welders and plumbers, those jobs make big bucks.  2) Beyond this, blame Apple, and then yourself.  They employ millions in China just so they can make the iphone 100 bucks cheaper for you to buy and they can bank 100 extra in profit.  Oh, and they pay far less of a tax rate than the progressive-hated oil companies.  So, anyone want to dispute these points or do you just want to cry out in agony at the realities of the universe.  I promise you the universe doesn't care.
Only if he makes it to double figures in the primaries and Hilary actually has to respond to him. Otherwise it's just background noise. 
good. The TPP is a job killer that would help enrich the super wealthy even more then they are now.
&gt; No problem I will do it for you:  But you didn't.  &gt; I’ve said that he misused the authority granted to him.   That sounds decent.  It doesn't say that she "wrote" the resolution.    &gt; She wants to blame it on someone else--because Bush misled her.   What do you mean "someone else?"  What do you mean Bush? Bush did mislead her as he misled everyone outside the Bush administration, but everyone related in the Bush administration was engaged in the deception. Everyone from Cheney on down, all the way down to Doug Feith.   And no, you didn't verify what I asked about.  
I get it already. Reddit (at least /r/politics) wants /u/SenSanders to win. Can we talk about anything not directly related to him? I mean really. Everybody needs to just start reading something that doesn't simply reinforce existing views. There are so many issues /u/SenSanders would rather be discussing than his chances at the presidency. Help inform the electorate, don't just use /r/politics as a campaign forum. Have people read about the issues, or anything he says will most likely be lost on most people in the first place.
So he's evil because he won't denounce and condemn Israel? At least your bias is obvious. 
your marginal tax dollars would do more good going straight to a local charity. you can either let the money filter through the government and hope it gets to an efficient place, or you can find a worthwhile cause on your own and write a check every so often to them.
I agree but that doesnt happen esp when people pay for tv ads that claim one thing then the candidate does the opposite. 
1. Sweden didn't really become socialist until 1990 - after that the economy spun out - and arguably has never really recovered.  2. Residents of Pyongyang seem happy as well.  3. Do you think the democratic riots and looting in Baltimore is immoral?
So many things to love about Bernie:  -He's stolen all of the thunder on the left, by actually vocalizing what most of the left believes. It feels like being out of the closet. If this propels him to the nomination, great. -If Hillary still ends up winning, she'll at least have to move more to the left due to his stances. If she ever gets a chance to talk about anything besides BenghaZZZZi or her campaign money. -Fox News will actually blow an O-ring if they have to talk seriously about a REAL socialist. They're gonna lose their shit. 
Yeah...we have that more "productive force"...it's called the FDA, it works really well.
&gt; Well $13/hr isn't really $13/hour with various income taxes and social security, etc.  Well, that's an even better reason to do it by state/municipality, since some states have just the federal income tax (TX and FL, IIRC) and others have state taxes on top.   &gt;So assuming 15% comes out of your paycheck, $13/hour means only $22,100/year, and in your spending analysis you didn't even include things like putting some money into your savings/rainy day fund/retirement fund, health insurance, money for entertainment (like going out to dinner and movies), and one time emergency expenditures.  You listed:  * Long-term expenses (savings/rainy day/retirement). Like I said, minimum wage jobs should be seen as a stopgap measure - if you're working minimum wage, you should probably be more concerned with getting a better job than saving for retirement or a trip to Disneyland.  * Extras (entertainment/dinner/movies). I understand that everyone needs to unwind, but there are plenty of ways to entertain yourself for free. Have a date? Cook something and rent a movie for free from the library (or use a Redbox code). Buy an old PS2 from a thrift/pawn shop for a few bucks. "Entertainment" shouldn't be a significant enough expense for a minimum-wage worker to need significantly more.  * Stuff that the average person earning minimum wage worker won't have to pay (health insurance). Post-PPACA, someone earning minimum wage should be able to get health insurance for free after the subsidy.   Emergency expenses are important, but impossible to really calculate because they're just that: emergency instead of routine. Again, though, we're talking about jobs that are predominantly temporary. Even a Wal-Mart cashier earns above minimum wage, with a raise after 90 days and another every year. In theory, minor raises should take care of minor emergencies and minimum wage probably couldn't be high enough to cover major emergencies anyway.
Because coercion is immoral.  Theft is immoral.
It was set up that way to make actual gridlock and prevent "tyranny", but I find the opposite is happening.
I know, right? Way completely shocked.  
&gt; You should try thinking for yourself. It is a wonderful thing. Boycott FOX advertisers. Its easy to do. Spread the movement.   Wouldn't that be great. 
How likely do you expect Bernie is to win the Presidency? 
&gt; The big issue is IF more than 250 times our Secretary of State demanded that other nations give her a bribe to help them?  According to?   The thing is my claim is it's not a "big issue" because she didn't.  Now prove it.
Pants on fire and he wasn't even challenged when he said it!!!!
What about rooms that don't have air conditioning?
I don't understand here. Are you arguing that the Republicans are not the conservative party, and that democrats aren't the liberal party in america? You're just wrong.  As for the guy that commented, he states he is essentially socially liberal but said he's conservative. I assume he means economically conservative. My point is that the democrats have been more economically conservative than Republicans for a long time, and that they match his socially liberal points of view.   My entire point is that there is no reason to even identify as conservative when the main liberal party in america is where your views line up. There are other smaller parties that can be liberal or conservative, but they are not even remotely in any position to win. That's why they identify specifically as that party when asked. "I'm a libertarian" "I'm all for the green party" etc.  It seems you attempted to grasp at straws and failed miserably. 
&gt;refuses to take money from the rich and powerful.  How does he win? 
Read that comment though, it makes no sense...free markets are doomed to fail? You must regulate a market to keep it free? That just sounds like a lot of cognitive dissonance, like you're trying to convert me to your religion. 
Its like Obama '08 all over again. Only this time their chosen candidate is not going to win even the primary...
Do you want a 50% income tax? Because that's how you get a 50% income tax.
Now, Jim Webb, though...   That's a guy I can see running a country. He understands the politics, the game.
Do you follow politics at all? He's the only one trying to clean up the mess that is currently the government. Everyone else is brought and paid for by the billionaires. If he gets in we will get to see a government based on reason. The other candidates only ever support something if it will be easy and gain them support. He will follow his principles and try get the people a better deal.  He is literally the only sensible choice! Anyone of the other candidates are paid for by establishment. And will be window dressing. That's why I say it's in danger. 
Your statement doesn't support liberty, the foundation of the US. Why should I pay more in taxes because of the poor decisions of others? Why can't charities and other organizations cover the needs of the people that truly need it?  Edit: I see the downvotes from the liberals coming in. You all just can't get behind libertarian ideas can you?
you don't know what liberal means. do some research. 
That's not my concern at all. I'm concerned that while she *votes* for these bills, she wasn't the one introducing most of them. She wasnt the one publically championing them. She wasn't *leading* except perhaps behind closed doors.  She sees things and judges them, from my perspective. And she does fine there. I was happy with her in the senate. What I don't see her doing, haven't seen her do, or maybe just missed her doing (should be hard if her campaign is on top of things) is presenting her *own* ideas and getting buy in not just from other congress people, but also from the public.  In my mind, and especially in her last presidential campaign, she was missing *vision* and *leadership*.
Not sure if /r/politics or /r/Circlejerk
I've seen Webb and O'Malley's names tossed out a few times, but don't know much about them.

When did reddit become a Bernie Sanders propaganda machine?  Oh right, yesterday.
why are you so defensive about this? lol Ive told you I'm not against this. How is my logic flawed? Do you think you need car insurance if you've never been in an accident? Of course not but we all understand its to protect everyone. Just like I understand this is to protect everyone. Ive never been to a hospital I thought I didn't need it but I do know ill need it one day. I agree with you, its not to your liking but shut up about it already. 
&gt; You can have a diverse country with income equality, a strong middle class, healthcare for all.  Where is this country? I'd love to see it.  In principle, sure, he's right.  In reality? Try getting everyone in a diverse country to help fund "some other" community's healthcare with their tax dollars while the corporations/politicians/the media are accentuating their differences.  Bernie is asking "why not here?" Why not here because of exactly the reasons I listed.
Good ol' Rick Perry! Can't wait for some more hilarious campaign ads.
Sounds a lot like picking winners and losers to me.    I thought Rs  didn't like that or is it just when they claim Obama does it?
It's the media owned by our corporate overlords as well.  We live in the era of disinformation.
Nope he won't be happy until every citizen is paid the same - no matter their skill level or position.  The crash and burn around here will be fun to watch when he doesn't get the nomination. 
I'll be votin NDP as well as most of the voters under 35 that I know. I don't think they have much of a chance of taking over government tho, the polls predicted a wildrose landslide last election and that didn't quite pan out so I won't really believe it until I see it. Doesn't mean a guy can't hope tho. 
You sound like a political consultant.  That is a non-judgmental comment.
She's not going to stand up to Wall Street. She's bought and paid for by Wall Street. Democrats will still vote for her anyway, I guarantee it.

Here, this essay, [Putting Health First](http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National_Office_Pubs/putting_health_first.pdf)- tellingly from Canada, does one of the best jobs Ive seen in explaining the GATS attack on public healthcare in a clear and concise way. Its author, Scott Sinclair, has done a lot of very highly regarded wroting on trade deals, if you look at the other articles he's written on the CCA site you'll learn a lot about FTAs-   This is a general article about GATS, [Facing Facts](http://policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/facing-facts) -  Its old- but its quite clearly written..   Why are they pushing so hard to privatize so many services?  Part of the reason is because those formerly public jobs, coming as they do from public spending, can then become "water" (the ultimate ungoogleable term)   High perceived value service jobs in schools, hospitals, energy, finance computing services, etc. are effective bait which can be used to gain leverage in trade negotiations- to draw countries into the US/EU trade deal orbit.   the biggest country in the world, india, has made it clear that its main objective from trade deals are the so called "Mode Four" committments for opening of service sector employment to international competitive bidding.  this will be done by setting up an international competitive bidding web site where all public contracts in the 50 member countries (at the beginning) and later probably many more, can be put up for international competitive bidding as they expire (most existing contracts come up for bidding at regular intervals)   basically, the FTAs are waging a war against local preferences and laws (including immigration and licensing laws) which disproportionately favor domestic suppliers of goods and services of all kinds, for example, laws which regulate wages or hiring, for example, laws that require hiring women might be seen as a technical barrier to trade by some countries firms that traditionally mostly employ men.. wage and hour laws MAY be challenged, and if so, the challenge could be expected to be framed similarly,  long followed laws might be challenged if they result in firms feeling blocked out- its really hard to say how far this could go. Its unlikely I think bit not impossible that existing minimum wage laws would be sanctioned but I think its quite possible that new minimum wage laws could be blocked- actually these deals standstill clauses I think clearly do block additional regulations preventing discrimination against, say groups or kinds of discrimination which have not managed to get laws written for them or in states which did not have them would be blocked by standstill clauses.  if they are different than the lowest common denominator- The same thing applies in other areas, there is a big controversy raging over environmental laws, the US wants to make Europe more like the US, where the last 25 years has seen a virtual halt in the regulation of newly discovered toxic and endocrine disrupting chemicals- (TTIP)   But to return to services, we need to understand these are potentially huge, utterly terrifying changes which Americans may be extremely uncomfortable with-  - set asides, anything that could be seen as acting to exclude a low bidding provider of services from a completely different culture.   ndia's independence and large generic drug industry which is committed to making generic drugs available to the poor in India and elsewhere makes them problematic for US special interests such as the well connected US drug industry.  one of the main goals of TPP seems to be increasing the prices of rx drugs internationally and extending the terms of patents and also reducing the downward influence of generics on prices.

You have lots of direct democracy. It goes by the name of "The Ballot Initiative". Now look at California following Proposition 13 from 1978 requiring a 2/3s majority to raise tax rates, and limiting property taxes. Now look what that did to their public school system (funded primarily by property taxes).   If you ask people directly, they want free infrastructure, free social benefits, free health care and free all you can eat ice cream.
It's like reddit has gone full retard in the last month. I have literally not heard a single rational, targeted or realistic goal set out by Sanders. Just a bunch of hyperbolic rhetoric that plays right into the Reddit circle jerk and everyone acts like he's the second coming. 
Name one European country more "right-wing" than America. 
I'm not a scientist, but I know that no one has presented me with any convincing evidence that global warming will ever be a problem for my acid reflux.
Yeah, that's actually a fucked up system you have going there. It's beyond me how you can lose the popular vote but win the election, and how the voice of millions of people will be ignored. 
Usually I get downvoted into oblivion when I share a critical view of what is essentially the mob mentality that Sanders is encouraging. Seriously, it's just populist rhetoric based on socialism. /r/politics is the biggest cesspool of mob mentality and has a clear lack of any critical thinking skills.   I could go on about Sanders but I'm still baffled that this guy can garner so much support without saying a single thing of substance. 
The rolling blunder review.
Creepy.
I'm an independent who leans conservative, but so far Bernie has my vote, because he actually cares about making the U.S. a better country. All the other candidates only seem to care about is enriching themselves.
To be fair, I don't recognize much of the doom and gloom of the r/politics comment sections in America, either.
As a student at a University in Texas where they recently tried to rename one of our main buildings after Perry (which failed, because no one wanted to enshrine him), please don't.   You're just gonna embarrass yourself Rick.    
True capitalism wouldn't be as perverse as this. This is crony capitalism. The ballooning power of the state has been manipulated to hand out favors for inefficient, bloated companies, helping them sell crap to over-leveraged Americans. Do bailouts for billionaires seem capitalist to you? Does a 50% tax rate for the top 1% seem capitalist to you?  And by the way, the way that the world's media organizations and government schools say "right and left" to indicate a political spectrum is illogical nonsense. Where would capitalism and liberty land on the current spectrum we have? http://www.forbes.com/sites/harrybinswanger/2013/11/13/statism/
The erection you obtained when watching this video should answer your question
&gt; So according to this, the problem is not religion or race. The problem is a class of people who use them to divide and conquer. That's correct.  ... AND the inherent racism and in-group mentality of humans in general, which makes dividing and conquering so easy. Pretty well documented in the social sciences. So yes, it's being exploited, but the divisions already exist. It takes a lot of work to overcome that.  &gt; Scandinavian countries achieved what they did not because of racial and religious homogeneity, but because of some of the strongest labor movements and socialist parties in all of Europe.  Sure, and my only point is that it's easier to coalesce a smaller population of very similar individuals than it is to unify a HUGE country of very diverse residents.  And of course, it's not just religious and ethnic or age or whatever, but the more diversity of the group and the larger it is, the harder to get people all on the same page, is all.  &gt; Japan for example is a homogeneous place. They're not Scandinavia because they never had a strong socialist party or labor movement.  It's a very fair point, homogeneity isn't everything, but it certainly doesn't hurt and we've already seen how easily the diversity of the US has been exploited by the media, corporations and politicians to keep everyone divided and from common sense solutions.  I don't disagree with what Bernie said, really, I'm just saying... the Scandanavian argument is pretty tired and doesn't really apply well to the US from a practical standpoint.
He's not poor, but he's not absurdly rich, either. After a very long career in Washington fighting for working people, his net worth is approximately $330,000 -- which, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, makes him one of the country's poorest senators.  source: http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/04/30/17261/12-things-know-about-bernie-sanders
Oh, my sweet summer child…
He's been around for quite a while.  So go check his actual voting record.  This guy is the real deal and absurdly consistent for a politician. 
Why do people focus on the wrong problem. The problem is not people having a billion dollars. The problem is the corrupt politicians who empower them to do whatever they want, through legislation that favors there companies interests.
Can you give some examples? I mean here in America the right is pretty much the entire main stream spectrum, both Republicans and Democrats. That's what Bernie is calling out. He's not calling out some fringe Neo-con group or a group without political clout like the Occupy movement. He's attacking the heart of the matter which has almost all of the political legitimacy, namely both the Republicans and the Democrats.  It seems to me that the difference between Europe and America is that in America the tail wags the dog. Can you at least give some examples of this happening in Europe presently because I just don't see it.
Found Jeb Bush's main supporter.
If you want to get technical about it, then yes, a free market with anti-monopoly laws is a regulated free market. I don't think that many people would advocate abolishing anti-monopoly laws.
Do you also understand that the US is the most conservative first-world nation on the entire planet and that maybe the very concept of being conservative in such a nation is borderline extremism?
I'm a liberal, but not in the context most Americans would agree with. That's only because they don't really know what liberal means. Semantics really do an injustice for identity here. 2 party systems suck. This is a direct result.

yeah because that'll seriously make a dent.  god i miss the days of yore where wars were funded by war bonds and students were in barely any debt 
&gt;Systematically structuring markets and regulations to help big corporations and billionaires isn't laissez faire.  Here's the problem: big corporations and billionaires in a laissez faire economy create structured markets and regulations that help them at the expense of everyone by way of legislative and regulatory capture.  The counter to this is to create regulatory and legislative processes that work against the natural trend towards inequality. But when someone tries to do that, they get labeled a socialist/communist, and free market purists attempt to dismantle the efforts. When they succeed and the markets are "free", then the top dogs create their own regulatory structures that lead to inequality, making it necessary for social democratic policies to turn the tide the other way. But then free market purists take issue with this... and on and on we go in a cycle.  Do you see the problem here? What you consider to be the laissez faire state of the economy is inherently unstable. It's not an equilibrium point. Stabilizing it at the point you would consider laissez faire requires both political and economic oversight, but then it's not laissez faire anymore. Which brings us to the practical conclusion that we cannot achieve socio-economic optimality in our markets without intervention.
You're right, we have a greater level of unemployment and income inequality.
this dude knows he has to go along with that "i support israel" bullcrap because if he said otherwise, the media, and the opposition would be on a smear campaign against him like white on rice.  he's been in politics for 30 years and is choosing his opposing points carefully   Let him take office first and I bet he'd gladly do away with babying israel

Ugh. Join us in /r/anyonebutsanders
&gt; I know America is the richest and most powerful nation in the world because of it.  Bullshit. We have backtracked so much on what made us powerful and built our economy in the first place. After WWII, we put many social services in place that strengthened this country and helped make it into an economic powerhouse. A few decades later, and especially with that scumbag Regan (tell me how much you love one of the worst presidents in modern history), and the right wing had about-faced on everything that once made it noble and began repealing all those things that made us strong. We've been on the decline, you know? We used to have the highest standard of living on earth but that hasn't been the case in decades. We have always had and always will have a mixed market economy, meaning a little free-market where it promotes competition and a little socialism where it protects the population. It was socialistic measures in place WWII that helped us take advantage of a strong market in the first place.  Do you really believe WWIII to be a threat? You that paranoid?  Have you not heard the statistic that we spend as much as the next 10 nations *combined* on our military? We could cut our defense budget in half and still have the world's largest and most advanced military by a huge margin. And maybe the world would police itself a little more if we stopped for a bit.
[link 1](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP) [link 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita)  so by your argument, we should see that the netherlands should be spending more on their healthcare, because it's more regulated.   what does the data say?  Actually, don't bother replying you clearly aren't going to behave differently based on this conversation.
Well executive orders have become the norm as of late, so the Executive office is asserting it's authority, and without a 2/3 vote in the Senate and House, that order is binding. It's polarizing the country though, and that's a bad thing. We really need to get back to letting Congress decide our path, and let the President be our leader without compromising the democratic process.   
That is nonsense. Look at any quantitative analysis of Hillary's voting record and political statements and she easily is on the left side of the Democratic Party. Although the dems lean right in the last 30 years.
And Sen. Bernie Sanders would be right. 
This is by no means a deal breaker. Also, there is nothing that will make me vote republican based on this veritable who's who of bible thumping, chauvinist, rich assholes. 
They will just get rich again. Its not a lottery. You have to alter the rules to beat them.
Ok. Let me ask, if someone offered to make a $25 bet on Bernie winning, where you get $25 if he wins and pay $25 if he loses, would you take it? 
This just in: moron opposes trade agreement.
The world isn't quite as black and white as you seem to believe it is, which is a huge element of our current bipartisan gridlock that continues to benefit only the wealthiest people of our nation.
Sanders is actually Darth Sidious. xD
I agree, people seem to want these whole and complete fixes to their problems when the real world is shaped and formed by baby steps in certain directions. This is a good step in the right direction

Socialism requires regulation and a free market is not regulated.
Misleading editorialized title
He's a true conservative, the so-called conservatives in congress are just corporatists. They're hacks and plutocrats. 
I doubt they will pass anything. Boehner would be pissing away his speakership if he did. Too many safe district seats would undermine him and replace him. The Dems have to worry more however, because any discontent with the law is their problem. There wasn't a single GOP vote for it, and it still remains unpopular especially among groups who consistently vote. Also low info voters won't know shit about King vs Burwell anyway. A sputtering economy right now might be the death knell for the Dems if it turns into a recession. .2 percent growth is pitiful. 
Yeah I'm gonna vote for him. But wtf is my single vote going to do against the billions of dollars of advertising the other candidates get?
No. But I am strongly interested in people thinking critically- and a major aspect of that is distinguishing between what one would like to have happen and what is likely to have happen. Betting is an excellent way of getting people to do that. 
Socialism doesn't require regulation. A free market where every firm is a co-op (each employee owns an equal share of the business) is still socialism despite the absence of regulation.  And a market where the government tells you what to buy, what to make and what the prices will be is still capitalism if the means of production are owned by private individuals. 
DAE conservatives borderline psychopaths? 
So does that mean you'd be willing to vote for him if he got the Democratic nomination?
Seeing multiple posts about the same politician on every page for days on end is exactly why /r/politics is no longer a default sub. Unless you're a hardcore fan, it just gets annoying.
Medicare is (relatively) easy though. All 50 states already participate. I'm sure Republicans will go out of their way to screw the poor, but they will risk the ire of their base if they are seen in any way messing with Medicare.
The voice of fucking reason here... but you'll be downvoted and ignored. Nothing can stop the Sanders Jerking. 
I really enjoyed that TED talk. I appreciate you sharing that. It is always great to hear from the top perecenters that actually understand the world and are realistic at the same time.
Do you know what a straw man fallacy is? That's what I'm referring too. And I never said he doesn't believe what he's saying, or stand by it. But he spouts ridiculous statements about the economy that amount to nothing more then blaming rich people for societies problems.
WTF?? This post isnt about Bernie Sanders? 
I think everybody underestimates Bernie and the extent to which average Americans are pissed and desperate. If the US elections were truly representation of people's will, he would win by the landslide. But since US elections are decided behind the scene by powerful string pullers, Bernie might not win. Unless American voters truly get pissed, refused to get phuked any longer and make sure their voices are heard loud and clear. 
Your sarcastic pessimism really adds a lot to the discussion, and definitely helps this country change and progress. 
I'm really starting to like this guy. Does he have a chance?
We have closed primaries. You don't need to specify a party in the primaries when you register, but you need to when you vote.
nevermind, I'll stick to people who don't live in fantasyland. get back to me once you learn the actual definition of socialism, and maybe I'll be more interested  in what you have to say.
Well, yes, I think that is probably a more precise way to put it.  However, Senator Sanders *is* focusing on creating jobs for young people.  The first point on his platform is a massive jobs program to fix this country's infrastructure.  And personally, I'd rather see young people working to rebuild America instead of sending them overseas to fight unnecessary wars.  War is a terrible, terrible way to handle youth unemployment.
I'm an independent and have been following Dr. Carson closely for a little while now. I have a hard time with some of his hardcore beliefs, but I really like his anti-PC stance, it is getting out of control in Washington. People say he hasn't been around politics enough, but maybe that is exactly what we need. 
Well warm, anyways

Wow, calling out Adelson as well. Nice, Bernie!
This was covered extensively during his last run for president.  It was proven that he didn't write them.  Weird that someone would bring this up for no reason.  
In a laissez-faire scenario it always ends this way. That's why you need regulation.
Honestly, I hate to say this, I think he's the liberal Ron Paul. Huge Internet flowing but considered a joke by mainstream voters. 
&gt; I would love to see a well-supported, legitimate third candidate earn a solid portion of the votes this time around - if it's not happening in 2016, it will happen soon.  No, it won't. The nature of America's "winner take all" approach is that the only real impact a third party candidate can have on a general election is to siphon votes from the party to which that candidate is closest.   Hence, a Sanders independent run would only hurt Democrats--just as, say, a Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee independent run would hurt Republicans.   Without proportional representation, third party candidates are a losing proposition.
I'd need to hear more to know if he is a good candidate, I'm just interested in him for now. I'm interested in his take on healthcare because of his experience in it and that's what I work in as well.
Older white male with an impeccable record running on a message that everyone can get behind.  If we could vote in and reelect a black president from the fringes, I suspect Bernie could nail this.
He's not too old to get nominated, for sure. John Carey was older, and is still knocking about in congress to boot. It didn't come up too often, though being old wasn't a new idea, being black or a woman definitely were.  If that's too old for a president is a different, harder question. Bernie is very much with the times though, which is a big fear I would have about most old candidates. I'd expect his life expectancy is still longer than, say, Chris Christie's though.
I didn't expect to garner such disapproval from a fact... hurrr durr, our ELECTED officials aren't doing what we want them to, better just keep reelecting them!
Incentives can't work with tenure and last in firing policies advocates by unions.
He wasn't talking out of his ass, he was just bullshitting. 
If everyone in America worked, and paid a flat rate tax it wouldn't be an issue. The biggest difference between us and Scandinavian countries or a country like Switzerland is work ethic. There's too many useless people here who would rather live off the gov for free, than get off their asses and work. 
Most of them gained the vast majority of their wealth through inheritance and allowing that capital to be invested.  Deprived of that capital, they would have to do some productive labor to build up another fortune.  If they do that and become extremely successful, that's great in my opinion.  I'm a big believer in the idea that people should be rewarded for hard work that benefits society.  How do you think the WalMart heirs would regain their wealth if they were forced to start again with only, say, $500k in their savings accounts (to buy a house, car, and education)?

I wasn't comparing them to American politics, and it's actually you who are by claiming these parties are fringe. They only appear fringe in contrast to the only two parties that appear in American politics, which by comparison are monolithic. At the parliamentary level True Finns hold a respectable 20% of the seats. If your metric of legitimacy is how they are treated by mainstream(leftist) media and politicians, then there will never be a satisfying opposition short of revolution.  Front National is another party that is by no means fringe. In the first round of parliamentary voting they achieved 13.6%, and are expected to do far better in the next election. Look at how well they did last year in the EU parliament elections. To say that a party needs decades of relevance to be legitimate is actually the most conservative position I could ever think of.  &gt;combines left-wing economic policies[16] with conservative social values..." is the same as our left party with their focuses reversed.  You're making ridiculous assumptions from the opening paragraphs of a wikipedia page. Look at the actual policies which they advocate, and see if you find that anywhere in either American party. Republicans have been trying to co-opt the Hispanic vote from the Democrats by pandering to Catholic sensibilities, a far cry from actual ethnic nationalism.  The point is, these are all political parties that exist in Europe, whereas nothing even remotely close to the policies of these parties is being entertained anywhere in America. It is undeniable that there is currently a hard swing to the right all across Europe, with the primary motivator being immigration(invasion).  I also didn't even bring up major or ruling parties in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Austria, and other countries that fall outside the western European sphere of acceptable ideologies. Never will you see a nationalist party in America, the Republicans are thoroughly free-trade globalist, multicultural, mass immigration, interventionists, even if a few cranky voters claim to be against these things.
But **WHY** would anyone support Hillary over Bernie? Why would we the people want to vote for her, at all?
You're incredibly naive to what primaries do. You realize this will cause Clinton to become more liberal to win her primary, in doing so it gives the Republicans plenty of ammunition for the main race. In fighting and primary challenges like this are what lose parties elections.
That comment adds nothing of value.
Voting Record  From Jan 2007 to Apr 2015, Sanders missed 77 of 2,664 roll call votes, which is 2.9%. This is worse than the median of 1.5% among the lifetime records of senators currently serving.  https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bernard_sanders/400357
I don't really know what they do for a living on a day-to-day basis.  Without really looking into it, it seems that most of their income is from investment.  If they are actually the people making the investment decisions, there is certainly *some* productive value there.  Investment bankers provide an essential role in our economy, and that's why they get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it.  If the Koch brothers are making these kinds of investment decisions, they are productive to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars per year (and the rest of their annual income is *not* from productive labor but merely from the fact that they happen to own capital).  If, however, they are letting expert investment bankers handle their wealth, they aren't really doing anything productive for the economy.  I do not consider "allowing your wealth to be invested" to be "productive labor".  And I don't think people *deserve* any money they "earn" in this manner.  However, despite the fact that I consider it unfair and immoral, I think it's useful to allow people to earn money through investment because it encourages them to invest.  I consider it a necessary evil that we let people who happen to own capital earn some free money just from letting actual productive enterprises have access to it.
Welp, that means it'll probably break the first time you hit anything solid.
If you are comfortable at your current salary and can't be fired what is to prevent you from doing the bare minimum?
Having a billion dollars while completely disregarding the people who made it possible is the issue.

I'll agree that culture plays a large degree in European success given the socialistic approach. They don't have 13th generation welfare recipients who's lineage includes slave labor. Before you try to basket them all negro, white slaves outnumbered black slaves long before the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Serfs were slightly more lucky though. If they didn't die in the first 7 years, or get indentured longer for bogus debts, they got set free. 
comments like this please me.
I think the important distinction is whether they earned their money through productive labor or just through allowing their capital collect interest.  Bill Gates certainly contributed useful labor to society, and he deserves to be compensated for that labor.  His annual income now, though, largely just interest collecting on his wealth, and therefore, in my opinion, he doesn't deserve that money any more than anyone else does, since he didn't work for it.
fuck a political revolution, the evil fucks need dragged out into the streets by the masses and killed horrifically just like the french did.

Yes Bernie does say vague, populist statements that an uneducated base would eat up, but they do shine light on the blatant corruption the billionaire class has on politics, which IS a serious problem that Sanders would attempt to fix in his presidency. Also Bernie's call for "political revolution" against the billionaire class backs up his plan for the economy. Increasing taxes on the rich and cutting loopholes, in addition to cutting military spending/waste, would fund [Bernie's plan](http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/232224-sanders-1t-infrastructure-bill-would-be-cheaper-than-iraq-war) for a "New Deal-like" large-scale infrastructure project. This would create millions of jobs and stimulate the economy. I'd rather have a herd of people follow Bernie's "straw man" statements and get Bernie's genuine care for the American people in office, than have another empty suit in office that could really give two shits about the American people.  EDIT: I don't believe Bernie is a straw-man. Most statements he makes are backed up with long held stances and policies. What I meant was is that I can see how people view Bernie's statements as straw-man if they just read the titles of the articles and don't look into Bernie's Congressional history.
I, for one, intend to regularly donate. . .once I manage to obtain employment, that is. Kinda hard to donate regularly when you're unemployed and generally broke.
No it doesn't, a common complaint of politicians as a whole is that they'll lie to secure their vote.
My brain.......not able to understand.   Conservative wants to do something through federal government action........NYAHHHH!
So there really isn't an American dream. If you're wealthy it's because you cheated everyone else, not through generations of hard work and innovation. 
I'd rather stand for my principles than vote for Hillary.
Pam Geller and her hate group are going to get an awful lot of mileage out of this.
I agree with you... but there are a lot of people who think all that investment will be for technology that replaces workers.    But I'm not talking about the guy who owns a store or something like that... I'm talking about people who make their money by virtue of having money. If you are trying to control where money flows through taxation, you run the risk of forcing money into a bubble, which can have some pretty bad consequences when it pops
They poked the bear, and it woke up and bit them.  Imagine if a bunch of non-Christians decided the urinate on crosses and burn baby Jesus in effigy- would anyone be surprised if gunshots rang out shortly thereafter?  These people were perfectly within their rights to do what they did, and the perpetrators are in the wrong, 100%, for using violence to solve a political and religious problem.   But man, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, and committing one of the basest forms of blasphemy against a person's religion, especially one with an active violent fringe doing damage in the world, right now, isn't ever going to end well.  
You must not be Democratic leadership then :-)
Because it's always good when politicians decide which products to encourage you to buy  Remember, if they have the ability to randomly lift taxes on certain products, it also means a different administration can easily put higher taxes on the same products. I don't think that's good
CCC didn't just do recreation   The CCC performed 300 possible types of work projects within ten approved general classifications:  Structural improvements: bridges, fire lookout towers, service buildings Transportation: truck trails, minor roads, foot trails and airport landing fields Erosion control: check dams, terracing and vegetable covering Flood control: irrigation, drainage, dams, ditching, channel work, riprapping Forest culture: planting trees and shrubs, timber stand improvement, seed collection, nursery work Forest protection: fire prevention, fire pre-suppression, firefighting, insect and disease control Landscape and recreation: public camp and picnic ground development, lake and pond site clearing and development Range: stock driveways, elimination of predatory animals Wildlife: stream improvement, fish stocking, food and cover planting Miscellaneous: emergency work, surveys, mosquito control[25]  so, they didn't just make the land usable by people. they also helped the land and animals, helped with public health and safety of the infrustruction that few people see.
It's pretty ironic how most here know that giant corporations suck but don't have an issue with an even larger government (the ultimate corporation). If we limit the power of the federal government, we limit the power of the largest corporations over our lives and therefore put more money in the hands of the middle class. None of this socialism shit
The question to me is, how do we get the old/middle-aged people to stop listening to Fox News and take these political stances, let alone Bernie Sanders, seriously? I imagine we're going to need them to get him elected
To be fair, you're coming from a society whose journalists have decided to censor themselves and cover up crimes or negative stories about people of foreign origin.  All over Northern Europe we see attempts to sweep problematic issues deriving from multiculturalism under the rug, even resorting to changing the names of foreign criminals into Swedish names in news reports.   [Here is a Somali journalist explaining the "hear no evil" attitude in Sweden's journalism environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as4m-dDubjg)

Bernie literally just announced that he's running...it's a big deal. You don't want people to talk about it?
You're both right. Although most of your points are true, a few are characterizations. e.g. Hillary did vote against extending some Patriot Act provisions, and voted against a Constitutional Amendment to ban flag burning.  Overall, On The Issues lists Hillary as [a fairly left liberal](http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm). That says more about liberalism in the US than about Hillary.
I like this guy. Too bad he's gonna die real soon from some mysterious thing.
Is that a yes, to a $25 bet? Keep in mind, I don't want to bet with you if you honestly think that you are more likely to lose the bet than not. If you think that's the case, I'd be more than happy to adjust the odds accordingly so you get a larger payoff if he wins. 
So you mean, he was talking out of his mouth?
I have no idea how you got that I was implying that. Are you disagreeing that politicians on both sides of the fence lie?
You realize that the baby boomers were waiting for their grandparents to die so they could change the world, too, right?
I'm saying that he doesn't have any of that sweet Citygroup and JP Morgan Chase money.
&gt; No one is this awesome.  Can reddit stop waxing lyrical over him and think for a  moment on how realistic his candidacy is, even if it is successful in electing Sanders as the next President of the USA?   I'm not saying he's bad or a liar, but anyone with a solid left-leaning constituency and a comfortable Congressional seat can afford to say this. As long as he gets re-elected to Congress, he's fine saying whatever he believes in. However, idealists don't always make the best presidents. Some presidents are more effective at pushing through legislation. Look at LBJ or Teddy Roosevelt. Both legends at getting what they wanted to be passed, passed. FDR also did this, exploiting the difficult economic situation as well as other opportunities such as attempting to dilute the power of the Supreme Court Justices. Then you have other presidents who are ineffective, despite their idealism (take Wilson perhaps). *** *Bernie Sanders may have a good heart and a well-thinking brain*, but if his ideas are too radical and his approach isn't perfect, he won't get anywhere. Plenty of reformers throughout history tried and failed.   The most effective reformers throughout history are either those who have immense charisma, energy, drive and political clout/wealth or those who use a very dire situation to harness more power to their chariot of progress.   I don't see Sanders in either one of those situations. I do not believe he has the connections, the wealth, the energy, youth or charisma to drive even 1/20th of what he promises and I do not believe our situation right now is so dire that the people will hold on to his every word. The Gracchi brothers had the wealth, the connections, the blue blooded *gens* and they failed in their agrarian reforms in Ancient Rome. It took Caesar, a man of truly poetic ambition, energy, drive, lineage, power and eventually wealth to transform Rome. Only after he seized a very good political situation. Reforms of such socioeconomic redistribution scale are always difficult to carry out. 
&gt; But it is millionaires and billionaires that are not paying their fair share today.   That's your opinion. In reality, the top 5% pay [the majority of income tax](http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data). 
In before the gargling of Muslim semen by the naive Reddit 'intelligentsia'.
When corporations first started, they were charter organisations that disbanded once they fulfilled their charter. For example, some wealthy people would start a corporation, and own shares, in order to invest in the building of a bridge, or a major construction project. Once that project was completed, or failed, the corporation would disband. This put the liability for success or failure primarily on the corporate entity itself, and not the business owners. The liability of the business owners was only what they invested. So what is interesting here, now, today, is that the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are, under the law, entitled to equal protection, and essentially, people.  It seems to be that Bernie Sanders should 100% campaign on breaking up monopolies and trusts. It has worked in the past and it can work again. Actually redistributing wealth from individual billionaires could set a devastating precedent. Because the American economy is also globalized, this complicates things even further. How does a national government "police" an international corporation?
It isn't even against their religion for others to depict Mohammad.  They're just deluded cunts who decided it's the ultimate insult to them.  They just can't live in a world where people are free to draw and mock their precious holy man.  Defacing crosses and burning effigies is far different than drawing satirical pictures.  (And no, I would not expect people to try to murder someone for doing that.  Threats, and people fucking with them, yes.  Guns and bombs, no.) So stop apologizing for them.
Oh no, I wasn't attributing the argument to you at all.   &gt; What I meant was is that Bernie can make seemingly general statements, which people can take for straw-man if they don't do they're research on Bernie or don't read beyond the title of an article.  Totally agree.  One of the difficulties people who want to criticize Bernie may have is that they just read a current general statement and don't know the background.   By the same token, Bernie has to ensure that his actual points get brought up and not just the general populist-sounding descriptions.
Glad you don't.
Ralph Nader ran for president 4 times with the Green party(Independent party) and he always knew he was never going to get the votes to win. He never had the money or marketing.  But his platform always sparked a stir among voters. This would cause the big money candidates to give their stances on topics. Ralph just wanted to get the people aware of various topics and make people talk.  But i feel Bernie will catch a lot of peoples attention. Best of luck to him
South Park (and a bunch of other shows) have been (literally) shitting on Christians and Jesus for 18 years, and nothing has ever happened.   But one Dutch paper runs a picture,  one French magazine runs a picture, some people have a joke, and Muslims are ready to fill the streets with blood.  Stop comparing devout Christians to devout Muslims, they aren't the same. Christians form awareness groups and throw insults. Muslims form mobs and throw molotovs.
Oh. good! More Republican candidates! Just what we need for our shopping list!

What a ridiculous post, and one clearly based on ignorance of what he actually said.  You think religion doesn't matter? Guess you've never seen the massive impact religion has on culture. You think race doesn't matter? Tell me, where do white, black, brown, natural born Americans and immigrants all have identical culture? You think language is irrelevant? Tell it to the thousands of teachers who have to teach subjects to children who don't even understand English.  Scandanavia is a region filled with almost nothing but one group, race, religion, language and culture. The outcome necessarily means everyone tends to be on the same page politically.   If this seems controversial to you, I suggest you travel more.
Yes, I would be suprised if christians reacted that way.  They would bloviate on the radio and TV, and write angry letters to the editor in the newspaper, and rant online; but beyond that, nothing would happen.  Well, they might deface the display, but no violence would be used.  I guess you don't remember [Piss Christ](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/13/piss-christ-sale_n_5317545.html).
So can hate and assholishness.  If you need to be politically incorrect to explain a new idea, it's probably a bad idea.
Or East Timor, Guatemala, iran, iraq, saudi arabia, pakistan, bosnia and many many others.  All had horrible shit done to them by the US directly or US backed dictators, usually coming to power in US backed coups.  Each of the countries you listed were in horrible positions in the first place which really sets up after a revolution circumstances that hurt a lot of people because of the preexisting governments and states and the existing ones either trying to get a piece of the action or dismantle the new ones.  Not to defend Khmer rouge or leninism.  Also, you post Venezuela but that is also a social democracy, which means it is a liberal country. Unless the new policy actually does achieve socialism this will continue to be the case.
I doubt any of them shot someone for making fun of Christianity.  Let's keep things in context.  
Well it comes down to what you think is politically incorrect. Over the past years saying "Christmas Tree" is not PC and can "offend" people. We saw with Charlie Hebdo people being called racists (which makes no sense) for being upset with Islamic extremists instead of being mad at the cartoonists for being mean drawing a cartoon.
They got billions through exploitation of workers, alienating them from their work, even anti competitive shit that goes against liberalism and neoliberalism(to an extent, but eventually every sane policy goes away in neoliberalism) and are generally only using charity to vent off huge pools of money that could have been doing good in the first place rather than 20 years later.
*Ding ding ding!* We have a winner! Bernie Sanders is "extreme left" and Republicans are "extreme right" - Hillary Clinton is the "moderate" choice for a new generation.^TM
But Republicans don't believe in sexism!

Because the hivemind here actually thinks he has a chance at winning the White House.   They aren't very good at picking viable candidates.
Then, for some reason those same people struggling are told to spend money on education they can't afford, and have to work less to attend it.   It shouldn't have to be like this. 
One example versus tens of thousands.  Besides, he wasn't killed because he was an infidel, or made fun of Christianity. He was killed because of a misguided notion that he was a murderer.
Let's just wait until the pain is so great that everything explodes spectacularly.  Fuck this proactive problem solving crap.  It doesn't work.  Ignore the problem.  Wait for collapse.  Then things will work out fine.  But try to solve things ahead of time and you'll just create naysayers who doubt your solutions.  When shit hits the fan, there is no more room for naysaying.  Then people have to admit that shit is fucked up.  That's why it's important to break this world 100% instead of trying to fix it.  Take for example global warming.  Right now there is room for doubt.  But if the whole planet is boiling, there won't be any doubt anymore.  So if you solve a problem too soon, you look like an idiot because only the most knowledgeable people know what you're doing and why you're doing it.  But if you are solving a problem that's 100 years overdue for a solution, then everyone will be with you!
One example of yours versus a million of theirs. I wouldn't bet on those odds, if I were you.
Hey Bernie,   Tell us how you're going to be the first president in 90 years to follow the Constitution.  Surely you know most of the problems we are facing right now resulted from ignoring the Constitution.  Right Bernie?  
Yep.  Sanders is such a good guy he'll put the nation before his self or ideals.
There's a difference?
Meanwhile being funded by billionaire's (George Soros nods)
Do you remember how Reddit, and the internet was fiending over Ron Paul being the next big thing years ago? People thought there was going to be a legitimate revolution. Then the election came around, and Paul did very poorly in the polls and came off as kind of a crack pot. It's going to be the same here. 
You say that oppression is the reason for their "condition" so matter-of-factly, as if it's not up for debate, but the truth is it's much more complex that you're assuming.  People outside of that group always assume that they're either victims or barbarians because of the extreme nature of their circumstances, but the truth is more complex than the black and white assumptions of the average 20-something redditor.
So again, all of this being said- if it came down to Bernie Sanders and one of the "bat shit crazy" republicans as you say- who would you vote for?
Yeah, why would people interested in politics be interested in a new candidate for President of the United States who matches most of the beliefs of young Americans and Europeans today? What a circlejerk: everyone in /r/politics just wants to talk about politics and shit. Pshhhh. There's, like, boxing and shit to talk about, guys.

He is against nuclear energy loan guarantees. The article mentions the billions that have been poured but seems to be confused that loan guarantees doesn't actually cost anything unless they default.   He wants to end climate change he should support a transition from fossil fuel to nuclear

That right there is the problem. Unless you just got old enough to vote, You are the problem with politics. 
There's a joke about that here in NZ. Story goes that one of our Prime Ministers back in the 80's, David Lange, was talking to an American school group who was out on a trip around NZ. He says "Now, I'm from the Labour party, which is like your democrats. The main opposition on the right is the National party, which is like your, um, Democrats."
I'm going to be really sad when his car crashes or he has a heat attack and they had no idea of his life threatening heart condition he had lived with undiagnosed since he was a child.

I don't think there's any organized conspiracy.  Reddit just has a lot of people who like Sanders for being an independent liberal populist.  He's the perfect Reddit candidate for president and the Redditors are going to promote him to the front.  Get used to it or create your own filter.
By that standard almost everything should be schedule 1. Beer. Coffee. Green tea. Cranberry juice. Apples. Avocados. Potato chips. Olive oil. Chocolate. Beef. Ostrich meat. Aspirin. Paracetamol. Almonds. Grapefruit. You have set up a criterion that nothing can meet.
HP was seen as a fabulous company? WTF anyybody who has ever used a HP printer hates their guts.
&gt;  Solid infrastructure and support for it? LOL.  I think you are starting to realize that government roads, funded by a monopoly - suck.  See China.
The political system is sluggish, antiquated, and dominated by old, white lawyers. Despite your cynicism, young people have every reason to want nothing to do with politics.  And to preempt; no, going out and voting isn't usually a very effective political gesture. The voting districts are almost all beautifully gerrymandered to prevent any meaningful change.
Nothing insane about opposing the party of ignorance, gridlock, and flagrant fraud and hypocrisy. 
Should be, but do we ever really? Ballots shouldn't even say D or R beside the names either. Make it about merit and not about the party. 
Small or big step, it certainly isn't a step away from socialism. And I am glad that you are against the ACA as well because anyone in their right mind would know the bureaucrats taking over our healthcare system is not the answer.
A crass title from a crude article from a disgusting publication funded by corrupt billionaires.  
That's what I'm saying, they don't fear judgement day, they fear election day. They don't want to lose their power, that's their central motivating emotion. Go after that, that's the only way to change their behavior.
Women voting for a woman who's running for President is hurting feminism.    Okay. 
Is the answer Bernie Sanders?
Did you open the link they have in their first paragraph? No, you saw "reason" and instantly jumped to conclusions.   Entitled: "I Am Voting With My Vagina: Hillary Clinton For President"  So maybe the crude article is actually the source one.   
If only Nader had been as skillful as Bernie, we might have had a more progressive Gore instead of Bush. 
Yeah, because hiring a man over a woman solely because he is a man is good right? Therefore it is okay to the same thing because it is a woman...  I think you are confusing feminism (the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic **equality** to men.) with sexists that think they are better.   You want true equality, vote on merit, otherwise all the equality talk is just a farce.  Edit* ah /r/politics, same bullshit just a different day. Just down vote and move on, don't have a conversation, don't point out why I'm incorrect in your mind. Guess you can't even read what the popup says before you down vote. 
my point is that this phenomenon is a consequence of a "two-party" system narrowing the scope of choice, and as is often quipped, "the election (especially for progressives) becomes about choosing the lesser of two evils" (some won't vote at all, and still others will "throw away" their vote on 3rd party candidates).  This is why I say that the political makeup of our gov't or more specifically, how people vote, are not good indicators of the desires of the populous.  Thus it seems that the entrance of sanders into the democratic primary is interesting because it provides the opportunity for broadening the scope of choice in an election where 3rd party candidates (which skew more closely with sanders than any democrat in the relative past) are left out, particularly in televised debates.
You assumed wrong.

Why do *you* think the Scandinavian countries work better?
&gt; Money needs to be reinvested in the economy, and not hoarded.  First, no, money should be used however the earner of said money chooses to do with that money  This is the problem with the progressive mentality that i have, this idea that we know better how to spend and use other peoples money than they do, and thus we need to punish them if they dont act as we want  but you said  &gt; Essentially, I would make it cheaper to open a Taco Bell than collect interest.  Why is earnings interest or dividend income bad, when that money is used to help start new businesses? 
Wacko anti-feminist Marxist Brit commenting on Hillary!   I'll bet he hates his mum, and hasn't been laid by any woman he hasn't paid.  
Wel three mile is considered to be the single worst nuclear accident in US history so there's that. What two nuclear meltdowns have you been presents for considering there's never been a total meltdown in any American reactors and only partial meltdowns in test reactors in the 50s and 60s 
This just strikes me as weird. Why do this? Who does it benefit, other than being yet another asinine way to tell your constituents that you're "pro gun", whatever that means?
I am shocked that one of the biggest media outlets in the US is 'shocked' by something that has been going on for a couple of decades at this point.
Bernie Sanders for Presdent!!

ATTENTION EVERYONE: Make damn sure you are not getting all your news from reddit or you will think sanders is the answer to all of life's problems. He might be great but I know a lot of people on reddit rely solely on reddit for their news which isn't a good thing because this is a huge echo chamber. Make sure, before you vote, that you do research outside of this website and look at other sources of information and news 
You vote for the black guy? Or you just another cracka Racist?

&gt;I don't believe that a single-parent should be paid more simply because they are so.  Neither do I, minimum wage should be sufficient to provide for a comfortable middle-class lifestyle for the worker and three dependents, regardless of whether any given worker has a spouse and two kids to feed. 
Can you say we've moved beyond sexism if we've never had a female president?  I'm a woman and I support Sanders but just because a woman said something sexist doesn't mean that we are beyond sexism in any way, shape or form.
Who's it shocking to?  This has been an open secret for many decades.  America rarely does what's best for people - unless those people are business men, politicians or their people.  The worst insult is that many of the mentally ill and homeless are military vets, which are supposedly the best Americans.  Yet even they are treated like shit, because the government is done using them.
The D or the R is important.  The whole idea of parties is that no one person can get anything done - it takes getting people into all level of government to do that.
How about people. How about people vote for their leaders.
Nope, Dems are just going to become the party of minority Presidential hopefuls. Next round will be another shill for corps and billionaires, but they'll be a *fill-in-the-blank minority*, so who cares because there wasn't a *fill-in-the-blank minority* President yet.
I appreciate the level-headed, thoughtful reply, but it doesn't change my inherent position that the authoritarian (as Bob Altemeyer and other psychologists use the term) is happy to see *other* people punished, regardless of how wildly disproportionate said punishment may be (eg. death for running from the cops). 
Whether intentional or not, you're glossing over the fact that Obama is pressing for Fast Track authority which would NOT give the American people or Congress sufficient time to examine and weigh in on TPP.  Contrary to past free trade agreement practices, this is a Constitutional violation since meaningful economic legislation ***should*** face a full-throated legislative vetting process in Congress, not get rubber-stamped without that process.  Fast Track authority is a tragic joke that deserves to be rejected.   Fast Track Authority (aka TPA) would also deprive Congress of the ability to jettison any provisions which it found unacceptable.  Since Congress is dominated by right wing stupid ideologues, Conservatives would ensure that every trade agreeement which came before them over the next 5 years (what Obama has requested) would have the legislative skids greased so Obama and whoever succeeds him can rubber stamp an expansion of free trade stupidity in the very same manner too. 
George McGovern said the same sorts of things.
We like some of their laws, is all. Or, as you might put it, "Heil Hitler!"
You mean he was lying.
Can't tell if you are serious or not...and that concerns me. 
Seriously guys, if you dont vote normally just get up and do it. Its time.
I am quite serious.  Do you think otherwise?  The whole idea of a democratic (or republic) government is that one person can't control events - it takes systematic agreement.
It is interesting how Colorado was out in front on a lot of those issues.
Smart policy maybe?  But sure, keep telling yourself that racial homogeny is the reason if that thinking helps you sleep at night
And the porn because we WANT porn.  Nobody wants politics 
It strikes me as pandering nonsense, really. If there's a sales tax holiday on guns - for that to make any real stimulative difference the amount of guns sold would have to be *enormous*. 
It happened in Mass in the last election with Gov. Baker winning less than a majority of the votes. The Democratic candidate and the left-leaning Independent got a majority.
This man has to win. He could change the course of history and set a slow but steady precedent to overthrow the constant domination of the two-party system in American politics. I really hope this man gets elected.
Yes, dehumanizing is the first thing they do.  The stars sewn onto the clothing of the Jews is a good example.  Before that, the press there had also been extremely racist against Jews.  It's easy to hate something that is viewed as "lesser" than yourself.  Personally, I think the GOP scapegoats because they have *nothing to offer.*  Nothing, except to the &lt;5%.  So its a matter of diverting attention away from their ineptitude.
I think our current political climate and the decades prior proves that that party line voting is not good.   Not sure why you think if you have no parties = one person. You throw a letter behind your name and you instantly get tagged with all these stereotypes and forgone conclusions versus standing on your own two feet and having your own merit and having people judge you by your own words and actions.   You put the best people in the positions and good things happen. Businesses don't hire based on something as arbitrary. They hire the best people for the job and work together.   Parties themselves don't even have systematic agreement within themselves so that doesn't work.   The founding fathers originally didn't want parties either, so it isn't some strange concept.  Edit* down votes but no responses. Why? Because nothing I've said is false, you just disagree with my assessment. Sad. 
Can you elaborate on "capitalism loses meaning in a world where only ideas and knowledge have value?" Tangible goods like raw materials, food, clothing, etc aren't going to lose their demand just because we're in the Information Age.
&gt; Smart policy maybe?  So why do Scandinavian countries get smart policies, while ours does not?
I thought that was hemorrhoid cream....
Of course. And some of their policies, no doubt.  Point is, why do you think those countries get those laws and policies you like, while ours doesn't?
But meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I don't follow Scandinavian politics closely enough to have a succinct answer to that question.    But I suspect that one of the reasons is that corporate interests have less influence on who gets elected in those countries
These weren't "victims" involved in innocent behavior.  They were being douches.  Being a douche should not get you shot but I still think it's okay to examine why some of us feel the need to be so mean and stupid.  Someone else's bad behavior doesn't vindicate the contestants bad behavior.
Or maybe because they put more money into education, so that their populace doesn't need complicated issues simplified to "derpaderp GOOD but berpaberp BAD" to understand them?
You want me to believe that you think the United States of America is an enabler of...Marxism?  You're going to have to explain how you came to that conclusion and how you think these three words:  &gt; global marxist oligarchy  are in any way usable together in the same sentence.
I know it's a surefire way to get downvoted in this sub, but I have to say I've read Obama's rationale regarding a timeframe for releasing the details to the public, and I think it makes sense.  There will be a time period when the TPP will be open to public review, it's just that it isn't that time yet.
That's what some of these folks need, a lifelong institution.  It's unreasonable to assume that every mental illness or behavioural disorder can be ironed out with the proper treatment regimen.  There are medical disorders and genetic mutations that have no cure, mental illnesses will be no different.  I think those that reject institutionalizations also reject the idea that some people are in fact incurable.
Fucking bullshit article. Slate has had some great pieces on Baltimore and race relations. This is grasping at straws. You can look for reason all you want. Sometime people just want to set shit on fire. 
There's always one...   You know exactly what I had meant by my use of the word politics.  Not the concept of being politic.
Nowhere is crime rate near non-existent you dumb fuck.
Also easy to do when there are no wars there. 
He understands what it means, he's mocking the fact that you are simultaneously claiming the money wasn't pork and that the money was pork.  Cruz LITERALLY was claiming the money was a bunch of goodies for politicians, and then you complain that the money was used as goodies for politicians.  
One man's pork is another man's treasure.
The red states thrive on pork.
&gt; None of it went to Democratic controlled states.  . . . and yet Cruz still opposed it.  Doesn't that demonstrate integrity, rather than the other way around?
Well of course that couldn't send the money then, Christie was just going to give it to his ~~democratic~~ republican buddies.
If a ship is sinking, and you save your luggage before helping another passenger into the life boat, you're a bad person. 
This is mind numbingly frustrating.   He didn't back that bill because of all the pork attached to it. Fucking look it up.   I'm not a fan of the guy but god dammit dig a little deeper people.

Don't they have a ton of debt, awful state credit, huge issues with homelessness and a bunch of other problems. Or maybe they could build desalination plants and improve water recycling. It's not exactly hard to see things they need to spend money on.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
What a shit article.
The [S/E shortage is a myth](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/). The core value of those degrees lies more in the fact that they're relatively resistant to globalization, although that's also been changing in some industries. The idea of a holistic shortage of doctors [is also questionable, with market mismatches possibly being a bigger issue](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/u-s-really-facing-serious-doctor-shortage/)--doctors crowding some specialties and ignoring others, or saturating the areas around the top schools, leaving other geographical areas understaffed. Nursing has [actually turned around its shortage](http://healthcaretraveler.modernmedicine.com/healthcare-traveler/news/goodbye-shortage-feds-now-predicting-340000-nurse-surplus-2025) and is on its way to a surplus.  Don't get me wrong, those are all important positions, but our country isn't really *suffering* for a lack of any of them. If anything, we should be more worried about trades, which have seen a decline in cultural acceptance alongside the push for everyone to attend university.  As I argue in another post within this thread, I think the lack of education within the Liberal Arts (which have traditionally been a mainstay of the bachelor's degree, but have also fallen in priority as we began to treat university as career training) could actually be a bigger bottleneck for our nation's continued success than STEM degrees are. We often have a technical method ready to go for a given problem, only for it to sit idle because we don't have the cultural willingness to spend resources on enacting it. Heck, we often have a hard fight just getting STEM research funded in the public sector. A lot of that unwillingness seems to stem (IMO) from a failure to reason about society and the roles and responsibilities the individual and government have within it.
Oh God the lemmings...
On the radio yesterday they were talking to an Oklahoma official that said most of the flooding was NOT in flood plains, so the people won't have flood insurance.  "They'll need help from the government to recover" he said.  Fucking Republicans.  "Small gov't, gov't out of my biz, rely on your church" until it's THEM that is hurt.  selfish pricks
"Economic Freedom Zones" rolls off the tongue a lot better than "Neo-Feudal Zones."  You know it's bullshit when they have to put freedom in the title.
Meh.   A true libertarian would be bad, but not as bad as Neocon. Huge difference.  Paul's nominations would be better than Reagan's, Papa Bush's, or Baby Bush's. In fact, I am absolutely CERTAIN it would be better than Clinton's.  Clinton would never install someone willing to overturn the "Citizen's United" ruling. That alone would be worth having Paul in. It is a decision so far reaching that it encompasses just about everything else, even the things I don't agree with him on would be positively influenced by that change.  I DID favor Paul solely for foreign policy, but now you are actually convincing me it is possible he could be better than even Sanders on domestic issues.  For instance, how hard would it be for Sanders to get a progressive judge through the nomination process? Pretty fucking hard! He may flounder in this department.  What is the saying, "It takes Nixon to go to China."?  I'm still going to caucus for Sanders with all my heart, even if my brain is being cynical. Maybe a ticket with the two as a third party independent run would be possible? I'd be doubly behind that. It would be truly revolutionary in our stagnant pseudo-democracy.
&gt; The libertarian-leaning senator's attempt to tie crime to **[a lack of]** spirituality, rather than to more tangible factors like poverty  Is correct. There are many examples where past Americans would go hungry rather than steal.  Finding Americans of that quality today, is far more difficult.  
&gt;The total amount of money spent through that process is virtually nothing in comparison to the total amount of money wasted in government.   The Sandy bill was about $60 billion, of which $43 billion was certifiable pork.
The details are nasty.  Money went to things like fisheries in Alaska and funding projects 4 years in the future.  It was an emergency bill that went through a quicker approval process, and everyone started sticking their projects to it.  Ideally, an agency needs to deal with emergency aid so things like this won't happen.
I want pretty much everything slashed by at least sixty percent, and a lot of things cut entirely. This includes defense to be cut to probably 20% of what it is now, we don't need to be spending money on war if no one is actively attacking us. Research funding and reserve soldiers are what is needed. DOA, DOE, most everything cut entirely except for police, courts, defensive military.
You know, for all the lambasting of the republican party going on around here for the primaries having so many candidates, at least they haven't defaulted to one individual in such a profoundly idiotic way.  Republicans are going to take the presidency in 2016 because liberals think Hillary is the only option.  Thanks a lot.
It's a religion with the Alarmists based upon the fervor and tenacity in which they cling to their beliefs and deny all scientific evidence to the contrary.  I never claimed I held any evidence. There certainly is plenty of scientific evidence out there for you or anyone to peruse should they wish.   The '97%' claim was debunked long ago. There's not even a majority of scientists who agree on the causes of, severity of and solutions to environmental issues.
I really think Sanders has a good chance to win the presidency, people are ready for a big Change with all the sickness that has happened over the last couple of decades.  Let's go all in on Sanders folks!  It is time for some REAL Hope and Change!
What is there yo call out. Look at his comments from the Sandy bill. He supported it up until it was loaded with unnecessary pork.
CNN didn't poll anyone outside their cubes...
so we shouldnt help texas to spite him?
It is not hypocritical if you know the facts. He openly supported supported sending money to aid victims just not in that bill that also sent tons of money to projects that had nothing to do with Hurricane Sandy. I think it shows he has balls for for standing up to sneaky government tactics. Politicians should have just gave effected states the money without sneaking all that extra spending in a bill falsely titled as Sandy Aid.
Because strong unions really are helping save Detroit /s  Source: Living in Michigan all my life
And you know, I'm fine with that - as long as they man (or woman) up and admit we're going to have to raise taxes to have nice things
A lot of people seem quite sensible until they get to talking about the Clinton murders or how Obama is using the flu vaccine to track gun owners.
Bad troll is bad.  he voted against a bloated bill with a ton of added pork.  Is asking for a clean bill to help people.  But MSNBC probably didn't cover that bit.
undisirregardless 
Bull shit!The ideas have seen the light of day and are spreading. 
  Bernie actually is in the flow with the mainstream Dems. His issues are their issues. So he is not sitting alone in right field like a bunch of Repub candidates.Cruz, carson and Sanitation, like many are way off the reservation.
This will probably get buried but I have to say something before Reddit goes apeshit.   Following Hurricane Sandy, there were hundreds of riders--provisions added into legislation that advance the agenda of Congressmen, and are usually completely irrelevant to the rest of the bill--added into the disaster relief bills. Many Congressmen NOT in the Northeast voted against these bills altogether because they would provide federal dollars to Northeast states that wouldn't necessarily be for disaster relief.   Cruz voting against Sandy relief legislation was a wise decision IN SOME REGARDS because it stopped federal money from going to things that were in no way related to Hurricane Sandy.   And what is he supposed to do when Texas gets hit with massive flooding? Say, "I think we're alright, the rest of the nation can carry on"? He has an obligation to his constituency to at least ASK for relief aid, even if he doesn't get it. He can be crazy, but give the guy a break. What an awful post title. 
Because there might be non-christian sentences to death at some point.  Only 13% of people sentenced to death row get executed anyways.
&gt;Of course there is a debate. The debate is is 6 years worth of funding an emergency?  That's not a debate, that's your mental gymnastics.  We're not talking 6 years of food and aid for people who lost their homes. Some of that spending went as far out as 2021.   In no realm of common sense is any more than 30% of that funding 'emergency disaster relief'. Any attempt to suggest that it is, is disingenuous.  Like I said, your brain doesn't want to admit that you're wrong because you see it as losing, so you'll keep grasping and grasping so that you can believe you're right - which is what you're doing now by concocting some nonexistant 'debate'  I'm telling you that it's okay, it's normal, just let it go. It's okay to be wrong sometimes. The other side isn't always bad and your side isn't always good - that's life.
&gt; Generally, absolute statements need to backed up, plus that list says there's net positive ratio, so they do have more federal revenue than spending in Texas. ($249,912,000,000 vs $204,985,000,000).  Look at it year by year.  
Someone should rape and impregnate him, then see how he feels about this. 
Besides Feingold and Vinehout?  And Baldwin?  We've got good ones.  They ran someone so bland that they deserved to lose.  Mary Burke was a joke of a candidate.
I don't think Cruz things that at all; he's doing what's best for him and his donors.
Republican senators only think government spending creates jobs when it is a defense contractor in their state.
Or the ones who had to earn getting college paid for through the GI Bill.
I bet their competition is, and that all things being equal, these state controls of trade and industry, in the form of subsidies and regulations, have everything to do picking winners and losers. This is why so much money gets pumped into lobbying for these favorable corporate advantages.   With this government *aiding of capital,* I guess we can go ahead and call it capital-ism, but it sure is pesky how these terms end up getting all meshed together, making it difficult to discuss anything. 
Absent a change of direction in our government from protecting busine$$ to protecting taxpayers and consumers, there are going to be a lot of homeless elderly people in our nation's future.
Of course it would.  Anyone who pushes any liberal policy is going to be opposed to the death by the idological fanatics on the right, no matter how "perfect" they are.  Not only that, but even if the Democrats were perfect, the Republican propaganda machine would do quite a good job at convincing a huge segment of the country that they were terrible people.  Now, of course in reality, the Democrats aren't perfect; no human ever is, and certanly no political party ever can be.   But whatever flaws you may think there are within the Democratic party really isn't the problem here.

They are quite useful if you want to extract value from labor and redirect it elsewhere.  However, if you think they are engines that create opportunity for labor, then you only know the myth and have not thought seriously about the reality.
Neither will Biden or Chafee, who pull votes from Clinton.  The point is that Sanders is probably overrepresented because of statistical omission bias.
"A woman enjoys intercourse with her man--as she fantasizes about being raped by 3 men simultaneously."   - Bernie Sanders 
Sounds like the overreaching hand of big government to me. #freedom. Or its hypocrisy.
Aaron Schock not ring a bell in your mind? What about Jesse Jackson Jr.? Hell, FOUR governors of this state have been convicted of crimes (either while in office or after).
If I'm full of shit, is it Ok to wear deoderant, then, or is that creating more starving children?

Wait - the message about rape fantasies? Or the message about how buying deoderant starves children?  With such a serious candidate ^tm it's hard to know which serious issue he's talking about at any given point.  http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/26/bernie-sanders-dont-need-23-choices-of-d  http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy
  I always wonder where the outcry is from the birthers when Canadian born Rafael Cruz seeks the Republican presidential nomination.
He wrote about a hypothetical woman fantasizing about raped. That's what you said, and I agree with it.  Where's the lie? 
I just prefer a more moderate candidate who will have the ability to work with a mixed congress. I gladly support Clinton.
I'm not misrepresenting anything.  Are saying Bernie Sanders *didn't* write about a [rape](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) fantasy?
Even if humans never go extinct, it is still correct that we are all going to die.

Isn't this called empathy gap?
It certainly starts with a [rape](http://www.vox.com/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) fantasy.
God I hate this shit why can't anything just be presented honestly
No.  But it could rent a room somewhere.  A private, one bedroom apartment should be a privilege not a social expectation.   The more valuable you are to society the more your worth.     The more people you are able to make successful (in any form) the more you valuable you are.  Be useful and you'll be taken care of.  The formula for life isn't that hard.  
&gt;Is there something wrong with wanting to change a system that you're stuck in?   Stuck in? Nobody forced them not to go the "legal contract" route. If you are saying you dont need or want state protections, why seek them?
You're right. Because it's an important, nuanced point.
Ask them how many of them accepted a job without equity or options and you'll see just how little they care about money.  Talk is easy, but look at their comp agreements to see where they really stand. 
It's a great reason to vote against it.  Congressmen lumping up random little projects into one huge bill is one of the sleaziest things Washington does.
A hypocritical politician? You don't say?
holy shit this sub is awful... Fox News appear fair and balanced at this point compared to you nitwits
They don't need aid in Texas, they need more bootstraps
A place to live should absolutely be an expectation for an full time employee. Not everybody can just find somebody who wants to rent a room out to them.
So is everything, property rights, murder, assault...that is all about imposing our morals onto society, the difference between these and the religious right is that one is argued using logic, the other is argued for because God and cherry picking.
Talk about having an agenda, jeez.  Edit: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201001/womens-rape-fantasies-how-common-what-do-they-mean  &gt;From 1973 through 2008, nine surveys of women's rape fantasies have been published. They show that about four in 10 women admit having them (31 to 57 percent) with a median frequency of about once a month. Actual prevalence of rape fantasies is probably higher because women may not feel comfortable admitting them.
&gt;A private, one bedroom apartment should be a privilege not a social expectation.  What the fuck? You can't seriously think that. Especially not in one of the most advanced countries in the world... 
I don't think you've seen me "hate on Cruz" here.  I don't take issue with Cruz' sentiment.  I'm curious about whether there will be evident hypocrisy, once the bill is voted on.
So NASA is wrong, the peer-reviewed climatologists are wrong, but you're right... Got it.
The media singlehandedly decides which candidates have a chance at winning 
Won't get you a *livable* apartment
Fuck the TV show how did this guy ever get elected for anything?  That's a rhetorical question by the way.   I know how. 
Wait a minute. I like Sanders too, and if he's the nominee I'll happily vote for him.  But whenever this subreddit talks about polls the bernie boosters are quick to point out that polls at this stage of the campaign are worthless.  But now that there's one that shows him gaining in support it's all relevant and awesome?  This sub will make me hate this man, I swear. 
&gt;A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused.  &gt;A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.  Ladies and gentleman, the future president of the United States!
It is an odd statement for a lot of reasons.  No one forced him to become a doctor in the first place, unlike slaves.  No one is breaking in doctor's doors and forcing them to treat the elderly and the disabled currently on Medicare.  Then of course, as you say, most of the rest of the world already has widespread socialized medicine and there continue to be doctors and nurses in these countries.
Do you all really think he opposed the so called sandy relief act because he was opposed to helping the victims of natural disaster? seriously, do you really believe that?

You're getting downvoted by teenage and early 20's democrats, and morons. 
Huckabee's son became relevant when the Huckster spouted off about parenting to criticize the President and First Lady. 
Sure, but that happens with every such "must pass" bill, and Cruz knows this. Since the answer isn't to simply avoid responding to *any* disaster since a disaster relief bill would serve as a convenient vehicle for pork, it would have been better for Cruz to focus his efforts on reforming the process by which disaster recovery is funded.  It could be something like a "disaster recovery fast track", but then people would complain about that instead just as people are complaining about TPA today.
She has said she won't, and her integrity is what her fans value. Plus, she has a completely other strategy in mind.

Yes, lots of us like him, but we are a bit left of mainstream.
If your looking for common sense, you came to the wrong thread.  I consider myself pretty socially liberal and pro-choice, however I honestly can't say I disagree with banning abortions after 20 weeks (aka 5 months / more than half of the pregnancy time).  This obviously has exceptions for when for some reason the woman went 5 months without knowing she was pregnant (I know this happens, that's why I said it was an exception) or when there is a health risk for the mother.  Seriously if your raped, are you not going To go the dr and get checked out to see if you got impregnated?  You should know well within 20 weeks.   Other than that, in normal cases where a girl  realizes she's pregnant (at what, 5-8 weeks give or take?) I think you should have plenty of time to decide whether or not you want to / should have the kid.  Seriously, what do people want, you to be able to change your mind 8 months in and have the doctor scrape it out? That's a fucking person at that point, if it was born, it would be premature but most likely fine.  At somepoint (minus the exceptions I listed) it does become murder IMO.

With Obama's poll numbers up, why shouldn't she.
Completely agree! A private, one-bedroom apartment is not the minimum in our society and it shouldn't be. People are too good to grab a studio or share with roommates?
Today's Democratic Party is more liberal than any party formation in 100 years, versus' today's GOP, which is only modestly more conservative than it was during the Bush administration.
Of course they should feel that they should have a place to rest there head.     But for minimum wage,  there is no way should they be entitled to a 1 one bedroom apartment in downtown New York or Vancouver.  If you can't find a room or a roommate maybe don't be a dick. 
Well...he is a pol from Illinois.  Edit: Yeah, downvote. Cause no politician from Illinois ever went to jail over corruption. Its the culture of the political class there, anyone who came up through the ranks 20-30 years ago knows how to play the game, and like clockwork, one of them gets nabbed every few years or so. 
To combine the two seems unlikely to me.  Realistically we have to choose whether to make colleges free funded by tax revenue, or to have a plan to reduce the debt of those graduated from college.
The argument is that: "[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached." 
We're never gonna get Sanders in office with an attitude like that, have a little faith man!  Sanders is the Change you have been Hoping for!

Impossible standards?   Dude,  I've served fries,  sold flowers,  shoveled shit, volunteered, volunteered and volunteered some more.   And at first I didn't have the skills and I was replaceable.  Then I learned skills for free.   Then I learned to be easy to get along with and understood what it meant to be part of a team.   Then I stopped thinking about myself so much and focused on making things easier for others.   Then I became valuable. Then I went to school. Learned more. Volunteered more.   Continued working for minimum wage.     And became useful to more people.   And now I can afford my own one bed room apartment.   It takes time.   It takes work.   It also requires one to lose their sense of entitlement.   Persistence and the value of failure.     But hey, maybe not everyone can learn life lessons right?   Then find a roommate. 
Because countries have been attacking one another without going to war for thousands of years. If every attack on one nation by another was considered a war, there would one-hundred times as many wars as we've had in human history.
It's almost as if people working for minimum wage (aside from teenagers/young adults still living with their parents) would have to seek out.....roommates....and shitty apartments. What is this country coming to?

The Hurricane Sandy Relief bill was packed with items not at all related to Hurricane Sandy.  Money for Nascar for example.  To be honest one must ask if the people who voted against the Sandy bill were voting against Sandy Relieve or the land slide of pork found in that bill.

Miscegnation laws criminalized certain marriages. They were still seen as marriages.   The word "legalize" has more than one meaning. There is legal recognition, and decriminalization.  Words have meanings, but that doesn't mean they only have *one* meaning.  &gt;Until you change the law, apply it equally.  And according to the law any consenting man can marry any consenting woman. Having conditions for laws to apply doesn't mean it isn't equally applied to those who meet the conditions. Having an age minimum for a driver's license doesn't mean people under that age are being denied their right to a driver's license.
Instead of all this arguing about these agreements we could simply unilaterally remove tariffs and call it done if we really care about free trade. If the agreement has anything in it besides lowering tariffs, chances are it isn't really about trade anymore. 
~~TPA ("fast track") has passed the Senate, but it still has to be voted on in the House. Even if fast track is approved then each treaty still has to be discussed for 60 days before it is voted on.~~  Let's kill them politician folks for trying to take my Game of Thrones torrents.
...I don't see how this challenges One Person One Vote in any way, shape or form. Misleading clickbait title. 
I agree, but accreditation standards need to be enforced, as they were in the case of Corinthian colleges. They lied about employment statistics to the DOE, and essentially tricked students into taking large loans.
Yeah... That's slightly different since they do that of their own volition. 
move on over Lindsey Graham! It's your time to shine!
This is the standard number for getting a mortgage.  It should, therefore, be the standard figure for all forms of housing.
I'm glad it worked out for you. Unfortunately it doesn't for everyone. You sound like an elitist prick to be honest. 
Dismissing people's religious beliefs as "superstitions" is bigotry. You're being being intolerant and disrepectful of others' faiths. You're also using sensationalism by comparing not serving a gay couple a cake to for their wedding to murderous terrorist groups like ISIS. Offending someone is not the same committing violence against against someone.  You don't seem to respect religion at all, but faith is important to a lot of people. To some, the rights granted by the 1st amendment are more sacred than those rights granted by the 14th amendment. I'm just saying try to look at the other side's reasoning before writing them off.
Sadly that is always going to be the case. The primary type of landlord who rents more cheaply is going to be one that doesn't give a shit. But is there a good solution? Rent control only enforces landlords that do not give a shit and minimum wage hikes only serve to increase competition among tenants while doing nothing to fix shitty landlords. Community housing has been a disaster in major cities across the US. The solution is not as simple as comparing minimum wage to the average price of housing (which is really just lazy rabble rousing).
Having to decide where to best spend money is a false choice? I haven't believed that since I was five and wanted two toys from the store.
If this Minimum Wage job was a rarity, I'd agree with you.  However, out nation's top three private employers pay minimum or close to minimum wage.  
Never vote because you want someone to win. This is a binary team sport situation already. Also don't take voting what you believe as an opportunity to say, "Well, I didn't vote for them."   This isn't a stadium. You shouldn't boo when the other team comes out and cheer when yours scores. When you do: the only winners at the end of the day are the concession stand, merch booths, and stadium owners. It's a simplistic analogy, I'm aware, but somewhat applicable in this situation.   Vote for someone you respect. I remember voting for Mike Gravel. I remember being the only person in state preliminaries standing there. And that was ok. It wasn't an OMG SO BRAVE moment. It was that time I respected the person who acted as the conduit for the Pentagon papers to be released.   Should his entire platform have been rebranded to "Grandpa came down from the attic and he's pissed?" Absolutely. But he was the only person on the stage not spewing rehearsed talking points and attempting to be on the Sports Night reels for easily digested clips. That's respectable.   Our political system is essentially doomed. And that's OK, too. It won't be some amazing revolution. It won't be a toppling of society or some Alex Jones masturbatory dream. This system of binary politics is not working. Democracy is rad. Picking between grape or cherry as the single viable option for that democracy is not.   Vote for the person you respect. Not the best speaker. Not the person who says the things that immediately benefit you. No matter what a presidential hopeful says - remember that they can not make laws. That isn't a presidential power.   Vote for the person you respect. 
Don’t let Charles P. Pierce hear you say that:  The modern Republican party, and the conservative movement that gives the party its only real energy, never has been down with this whole right-to-vote business—except, of course, as an equal-protection dodge in Bush v. Gore. The current Chief Justice, John Roberts, kick-started his rise in conservative politics by working to undermine the Voting Rights Act as a lawyer in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department.  (Roberts's immediate predecessor, William Rehnquist, got his start as a voter-intimidation specialist in Arizona. As a clerk, Rehnquist argued against the majority in Brown v. Board of Education, writing in one memo: "I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by "liberal" colleagues, but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed. To the argument that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minority are." Oy.)  You really have to admire how they've done it. First, they turn our elections into a plutocrat's playground (Citizens United, McCutcheon). Then they uphold in the main voter-suppression tactics designed by the candidates the newly corrupt system produces out in the states (Crawford). Then, they gut any remedy that the people against whom these new laws discriminate have in federal court (Shelby County.) And now, it appears, the day of Jubilee having been declared, the circle may be closing for good.   Back when Roberts was a rising young lawyer, the Republican party didn't have a problem with what "one man, one vote" meant. Then, the country started to brown up a little bit and the Republican party found itself trapped within the strategy whereby it had allied itself with the remnants of American apartheid.  It couldn't appeal to this changing demographic because its base would go indiscriminately bananas. So, instead, it committed itself to a long campaign to dilute the power of the new voters to whom it could not fundamentally appeal. And it's now damned close to enshrining in law the principle that any electoral disadvantage—self-inflicted or not—that conservatives face is prima facie unconstitutional. It really is quite something.    http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a35254/the-fix-may-be-in/
Debt free? Who's paying for it?
Except that Sanders is running for the Democratic nomination. He's not running against Clinton and another Republican. If he gets the nomination he'll be running as a Democrat against a Republican. Does no one get this? I feel like I'm on crazy pills!!!
Elitist?  No.  Realist.   There aren't the resources available to ensure every person earning minimum wage be entitled a one bed room apartment.  
*cough*  More.
"Why should we pay anyone a livable wage in this day of automation? Let economic Darwinism take the reigns!  If these people had any worth or skill they'd make more than the minimum wage.  No one deserves a living wage for doing menial jobs."   - rich assholes everywhere
Sue a company with more lawyers on retainer than you have family members, let me know how that goes for you.  I hope you have the funds to support a multi year lawsuit.
And democratic senators only want economic freedom when it benefits their own state.

You can't rent a place in Los Angeles without making 3x the rent a month. Even in the poorest areas, even if you don't have to pay for a car/gas/insurance, even if you receive food stamps. It's asinine. The 3x rule is meant to discourage people from spending half their income or more on rent but all it really does is fuck over the poorest people. Poor people don't want to be homeless and they don't want to be poor. I have no idea why landlords believe that poor people won't pay their rent before anything else.
Since when is withdrawing your own money from the bank a crime?  Hastert didn't owe anybody - not the bank, the IRS, or the FBI - any kind of explanation for why he withdrew money.  It doesn't matter why, even if he was being blackmailed, or paying ransom, or was funding local charities anonymously in cash.  It's none of your business or mine, much less the government's or the bank's.  His only mistake which we know of thus far was in talking to the FBI in the first place.  This is one of those "societal harm" bullshit cases that government prosecutors so love to dredge up to enhance their own reputation at the expense of an innocent's - to say nothing of the tax dollars wasted on trying to jail someone over a truly victimless "crime".
 Who would have known?. How is it possible?. Him a Hypocrite?, a Cuban Canadian that hates immigrants? NOOOOOOOOO. Shocking. 
Join the National Guard and have an on campus job.  I paid off my remaining loan in about a year.  But I'm sure that was too boot-strappy and not enough burden placed on my single mother or society as a whole.  Honestly though I am in favor of a national two year service program where you can either joined the armed services (a very low percent I'm sure) or other programs like a domestic peace corps where you can tutor children or help on works projects in return for tuition.
Yes. And by the same laws that passed on ownership of Bieber (you touched it last), Cruz is now also yours.   Now close your shale plants before we send you more batches of concentrated crazy.
All of the extra provisions enforce labor, health, and environmental laws, likely along with others. It's more than just lowering tariffs, and it should be. It's establishing the rules of the global economy and putting us in a position to benefit from it rather than be subjected to it.
&gt;Sanders doesn’t have the super PAC money, campaign infrastructure, or the political allies he’d need to win the nomination ...  While my vote choice is nowhere near from determined as of today, this is actually the primary reason why I *would* vote for Sanders in the primary and general election. I am not fully on board with a lot of his policy positions, but if he can take a decent share of the primary vote, or runs as a 3rd party candidate if he doesn't win the primary, it would send a strong message about campaign finance. You do not need a constitutional amendment limiting the 1st Amendment to achieve campaign finance reform. The easiest way to achieve it is for voters to stop rewarding the giant spenders and financially backed candidates with votes. If all that money isn't resulting in getting votes, and is actually doing the opposite and depressing votes (that is, increased spending would be correlated with less votes being gained) then candidates and their strategists would have to completely rethink how to run a campaign.  Americans can - at any point - decide they want big money out of politics by not voting for the candidates backed by big money interests. Justice Kennedy referred to this himself in the *Citizens United* ruling, and it factored into the upholding of disclosure laws. If you internally rank political issues and state of campaign spending and money influence is at the top of your ranking, then you should vote for the candidate whose actual campaign strategy does *not* involve the use of million dollar donations and Super PACs. I just don't think people realize what an affect it would have if Sanders received even a small percentage of the two party vote share, and the blow that this would have on political strategy.
Resubmitted with appropriate title, as the mod suggested.
The headline of the article says Clinton doesn't disagree with Obama because he's black?
If you have to look back over 40 years prior to find dirt on a guy, I have nothing to complain about
&gt;  but she does seem to think that there should be restraints against what corporations do and that they have a social responsibility  She also has Goldman as one of her biggest donors.  You **really** believe she's going to implement restraints and regulations on the people who's free speech put her in office?
He won't win. No chance. Dems are running Hillary.
It's very easy to write laws that don't include the word "tariff", but that still impede market access for foreign firms. Your countries firms need protection in case the government of another country nationalizes their product, or appropriates their intellectual property, etc. Barriers to trade are way more extensive than you learn about in an econ 101 class, so FTAs need to be similarly comprehensive.
Ahh, the ole' "if you're poor, it's your fault" routine.  What next?  We should give all of our tax dollars to the rich?  It's funny how forgoing economic growth in order to appease the rich and a growing population of the working poor go hand-in-hand.
Thank goodness for little favors. I just find you sad.
Why do I feel [this](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/913/758/a12.jpg) is appropriate? 
Henry Hyde, the congressman who pushed impeachment so hard and proudly walked the articles over to the senate was also guilty of infidelity.  He came over to my house when I was a small child.  My mom was holding neighborhood meetings at our house to interview candidates.  She came away very unimpressed to put it mildly.
I only saw an excerpt (if anyone finds the whole thing, please share).  This seems to be an article about the transformation of gender and sex roles and implications they have in romantic relationships as well as women entering the workforce.  
1.) He's only pretending to want Shia approval by following their forms for selecting a khalifa and 2.) basically none.
It's the third-worst in the nation. Based on current yields, the state's borrowing cost is about 20-40% higher than top rated, AAA states. That's not nothing. 
Embedded in the article:  http://www.mrctv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/dan4/sandersw.png
I remember this article from a few days ago as well.  Look, we're over analyzing it. We don't need to know if it is based on the average housing price or the minimum housing price. The point is that most people who work full time, at minimum wage, cannot afford a one bedroom apartment.  People who work minimum wage jobs, even those people who make more, tend to know this from experience. This is a reality, regardless of the methodology used here. And I think this is the message they are trying to convey (even if they could have polished it up a bit).
&gt;Because corporate welfare handouts  "Corporate Welfare" is a meaningless term.  What, specifically, is your objection to the bank?  &gt;Such things are a waste of resources.   The Ex-Im Bank doesn't cost taxpayers a penny.
Out of context and not quoted correctly. The essay says "a woman," not "women." It's an unusual style of prose, granted, but he's making a larger point related to Sigmund Freud's philosophies, evidently. But the title of the article is clearly misleading.
You can say whatever you want.   &gt;And then ignoring any argument that proves you wrong.  But that's the part you won't acknowledge. And that's why you're being downvoted.
This has been covered a few times already and I'll once again post a link to the best response I've seen so far, one that provides the context to make it clear that he was writing about the need to move past gender norms.  http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37me70/sen_sanders_essay_women_fantasize_about_being/cro1ttq
Sanders being unelectable isn't my opinion, it is a fact. 
That is because minimum wage is for kids. If you're an adult... get a roommate. 
Like public colleges don't have bs degree programs? Add that to the fact that if it were free then costs would skyrocket and the taxpayers would be on the hook even more than they are today

.."should it?"
That is because they are just quoting an individual tax not the combined impact of the taxes that are paid.  Start with the corporate tax, 35%, you pay this in the cost of everything you buy or use, and for every company that touches the item, then add the gas tax for every truck, plane, or train that ships your item, then add the local and state sales tax for the item.  Then you buy that item with what is left over from your pay after payroll taxes, state taxes, fed taxes, SDI, Medicare, and SSI, equaling another 35% reduction of your earned $$$.  Of course, the company pays you based upon their profits, and that is what is left after they pay payroll taxes, state taxes, fed taxes, SDI, &amp; Medicare.  Add it all up, easily 50% of what you earn is drained away by taxes.  http://www.nowandfutures.com/taxes.html
Point being, that's *insane*.  You shouldn't be spending more than 25% of your income on housing.
I don't think it's "fanciful" at all. 40% of jobs in Washington state are directly tied to trade, eliminating high tariffs allow firms to save that money and reinvest into the company to produce, sell, and hire more. You may say, "Oh, well those greedy corporations will just pocket all those savings and none of it will get down to us!" But I think this is a rather silly point, after all why wouldn't they produce more? They would make more money through producing more and producing more means hiring more people. So the process might be longer but I'm sure that it does get down to us little people.
Except when all of the employees are included the Dat shows she doesn't.  I'm not doing the same thing. I read both of the methodologies. One is much more accurate than the other.
My boss told me he recommends that I don't drink alcohol. I thanked him for the advice, last I ever heard of it.
It's weird because I don't remember saying "if you're poor, it's your fault" even after rereading my comment. It would probably be more accurate to say "if you're working at a minimum wage job, you're not going to be able to afford living in an average one bedroom apartment by yourself".
The 40-hour work week and weekends are basically non-existent for most Americans.  That's due to the lessening of unionized workers these last 40 years, and economic policies favoring employers.  1 million workers now make the minimum wage.  They would be making less if it weren't for minimum wage laws, not unions.  Overtime pay happens for some workers b/c of the laws.  90% of American workers are not unionized so they don't get many of the protections unionized workers have.  That 10% unionized does help many workers not in unions, though there's just not enough unionized workers to make the workplace good for most Americans.    Waiting periods, like in Canada, are a myth.  Canadians are very happy with their healthcare system.  Idk about the quality variance you're talking about, but I assume the many studies done on healthcare systems account for that.   
Right? It's almost as if working at a minimum wage job is less than ideal and people should seek out higher-paying employment either through promotion or lateral transitions.
LOL....so when they secede where will they get the money then?
43 years.
Due to the size of its economy california has no trouble raising more money than most states. And A+ is very close to AA, which would put it average for US states. You are obsessing over a small difference at this point, that isn't hurting CA in any tangible real world way. And you aren't comparing real world current borrowing costs. In the real world CA could out borrow many smaller states with technically higher ratings, simply due to the size of it's economy.

Forgiving him is well and good, but I believe the concern was that he would rape/kill again, which he did.
“A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused.”   Wow what a shit person. He just lost my vote.
That's some nazi level shit
Businesses are also tax payers and consumers... I'm not sure why you believe some people deserve more rights than others. They have a right to run their business as they see fit.  It's theirs. They own it.
Yup.  Kinda weird.  
I've never worked a minimum wage job since I started working at 16. Just taking a weekend class to get your life guard certificate started me off at $10 an hour,  when minimum wage was around $6.   Minimum wage is for unskilled jobs that you should not be trying to making careers out of. It's not made to live off of. If you can only get hired at minimum wage jobs, maybe you should reevaluating your skills, and see what you can improve in yourself.   
SCOTUS may give them some new realities soon if these hacks get what they wished for.  Because when you get what you want its your responsibility to deal with it.  So far Republicans haven't shown any real desire to govern.  
Well, title is certainly misleading.  I don't know what else to make of it outside of that.

He's polling like 40 points down. Of course they're down on him.
Exactly.  One of them said "What if Ted Cruz or Rick Santorum had written this?"  First of all, neither of them would write an essay about getting rid of gender norms, and second, both of them advocate legislation that is considered anti-woman.  Don't see that from Sanders.
He'll need to have a basic understanding of economics for me to take him seriously. But that would require him to stop identifying as a democratic-socialist.

Why are you surprised it is worded that way on left leaning /r/politics? 
&gt; the taxpayers would be on the hook even more than they are today  All for a better educated society like Europe has? I'm all for that.
I feel my tubes going spastic as we speak.
That is a highly simple look at a horribly complex issue.  The police, much like the military, are in a job where having someone who is going to care for your well being as much or possibly more then their own is required in a dangerous situation.  With the immediate caviot that such situations are not daily occurrences.    It creates this mentality where loyalty to the whole is much more important then doing the right thing.  Which we can see in the growing pattern of situations where cops who reported bad behavior were fired.  While having the mentality of being part of the group is important they need to internalize the idea that in much the same way the bad to outright evil done by their department if they want to cling to this idea of being part of the group is also their own if they don't do anything to stop it.  And even in this article under example one with the kid with crutches, the writer never told his partner to stop that she was out of bounds, or the other cop who showed up to stop because she was lying.  So he would be part of the 85% that by your standards should be fired.  But what about the second officer who showed up to the call and was told that someone had been assaulted since it is reasonable that he may have just believed her and was told a lie.    There is no easy solution to making the police car.  When a civil suit goes through the officer themselves rarely pay it is the city at large that has to pay. Which blasts a hole in the budget.  Now no city politician will ever think of trying to fill that hole by cutting back on the police budget since no one ever wants to be seen as soft on crime.  So other social services are cut.  Until officers who comit these acts and those that cover up are getting hard time with loss of pensions being part of criminal sentence, which I vomited in my mouth a little bit typing that to ensure officers act with in their bounds they need to be threatened with the loss of retirement money, I can't see the situation changing much.  
&gt; fostering workers rights or incentivizing innovation  It's more like circumventing Rights and hording technology into the hands of a few - stifling innovation.  The TPP is a global power-grab!  It's not about "free" or "fair" trade.  It's about the ruling class putting their boot into the neck of the working class.  I'm just surprised that its not call the Patriot Freedom Initiative (or some such).  Freeeeeeeeeee-Duuuuuumb!!!!

This. I am surprised this comment is even visible.  
Misleading title.  
Nope, she won't go to prison if caught. She however will not then be our president either.
It's funny how, up until about 30 years ago, that wasn't the case.  Something about supply-side economics...
It is a fact that countries have attacked one another without going to war, to claim that every armed conflict that ever occurred has been a war is silly.
&gt; This nation needs less people with business degrees and more skilled workers.   Then why is it that local jobs in my area pay shit for the skilled trades with no experience, but I can get a degree in quite a few things and make big bucks right out of the gate?
Life doesn't usually mean until death. It is an indefinite sentence that usually allows parole after a number of years. So if a life sentence is at least 40 years, life + 20 years would basically be a minimum 60 year sentence.
I'd voluntarily let cops punch, kick and taser me for half that amount.
What?  I did not mention employment of employees or employee benefits or wages.  My post is about the difference between PERSONAL and BUSINESS rights and obligations.  For tax purposes:  an individual cannot write off their rent bill -- a business can.  an individual cannot write off their transportation costs associated with personal use of their vehicle -- a business can.  an individual cannot write off their utility cost -- a business can.  an individual cannot write off the very thing which sustains them (food) -- a business can since the cost of production of goods/services sold can be deducted from the purchase price to determine NET taxible profit.  Citizens United notwithstanding, there actually IS a vast difference between the rights of a business and the rights of an individual human person and, therefore, it should reasonably follow that the obligations* differ as well.  Individuals have every right to "freedom of association" in their PRIVATE lives -- even if they want to exclude any flavor of "others" from their homes and private clubs and private church clubs and any other PRIVATE part of their lives.    When people engage in business with the public, however, their obligation is, or should be, to not discriminate with regard to whom they serve -- within the bounds of reason:  They shouldn't be required to serve anyone that is ACTING in a way in their establishment that disrupts their business; however, how customers act elsewhere is none of the business owners damn business.   That people in business and government cannot discriminate against others because of the color of their skin was decided in the 1960's via lunch counter and bus and school disputes.  The same thing reasonably needs to apply to any private beliefs and/ private actions of the individual -- employee and/or customer -- and, in fact, any actions of individuals in their personal lives while those persons are NOT IN the place of business --  those who disagree seem to be those that were, or would have been, on the wrong side of history in the 1960's and they will be on the WRONG side of history on this as well.
I agree. I just like pointing this out because it is so frustrating to see people, obviously educated, on these threads where there is a great chance for discussion which is instead buried in partisan support just because a certain person has a "D" or an "R" after their name. Partisan politics has done so well though...right? Must keep the status quo!
How many times did they swap leaders in 2012? Yet we knew all along Romney would be the nominee.
Society will always have upper middle and lower classes. These aren't nor should they be, equally split.  On a similar note who the hell hangs out on the internet complaining when they could be doing something to fix their problem or improve themselves.
Yeah - with only her and one other guy that no one has heard of in the race. I don't know why everyone is making such a big deal about her lead. The first primaries aren't until February 2016. This thing has just started.  Hillary has big numbers, yes, but she has nowhere to go but down. Do you think she's going to keep her numbers?  Also, take a look at the field she was running against in 2008. Looks a bit crowded. Her numbers wouldn't be that high if there were more people in the race.  I think come February there's some people fixin' to be shocked at what kind of numbers Bernie is getting.
Is it the employers fault when people can't afford an apartment in San Francisco because rent control laws inflate prices?
You're right that they're gun right types, which makes your tyranny overthrow scenario extra implausible. Either the soldiers are on the side of the tyrant, in which case everyone is screwed, or they're not, in which case the tyrant doesn't control the military and so is going to be short lived anyway.

Kudos to this young photographer, and to his parents, for standing up to an idiot (or idiots) in the school administration, but he made several mistakes.

&gt;you pay this in the cost of everything you buy or use  As a consumer, you pay *some* of it. How much is heavily dependent on the price elasticity of the good or service in question.  This is like ECON101 shit.
&gt; shouldn't we also be looking at the bottom tenth of rented properties?  It depends. Is it reasonable to expect them to rent the bottom tenth of properties?   They'd have to be available, for one. They have to be close enough for low wage workers to reach quickly, and low wage workers are less likely to have reliable transport. Perhaps most importantly, they'd have to be open to low-wage workers.  Many low wage workers have bad credit and/or criminal background checks. Most low to mid rental properties do criminal background checks, with those that don't having a captive market and asking more.  Thus there are a lot of factors that exclude low wage workers from the least expensive rental properties. Saying that they should automatically match up with the least expensive properties isn't reality. The cost of rural rentals is also not reality for urban workers.
Douche bag going to Duce 
Yes, for choosing to do business in that area. If you can't make a profit by providing a fair wage, then move to another area to conduct business.  Society &gt; Business.  If Society is responsible for voting in laws, Businesses need to feel the ramifications of that as well. Unfortunately, now we live in an age of subsidies that ignore this. Society should also be aware of the implications of it's laws on Businesses, such as the rent control laws.   I don't know enough about those laws, but there's nothing in the law that says that people NEED to live in places with high rent. Is there a location within commuting distance that provides lower rent? Move there rather than subsidizing rent. 
I can understand most of this but not this part.  &gt;just because the mother is in danger doesn't mean you can kill it.  So if your pro life it's ok for the child to kill the mother to save it's own life, but not ok for the mother to kill the child to save their own life. Why is the child's life given priority over the mother's?
What about the argument that without subsidies housing prices would need to come down due to lack of demand?
You still have not answered any of my questions or key criticisms. Obviously we can never know the reasons behind someones actions and therefore we use words like choose and choice to represent the motivation behind an individuals actions. Actions *are* quantifiable and if we omit the word choice from my previous argument then you don't have a leg to stand on.   &gt;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-012-2207-1  This study seems to be all about feelings and not about pay equality.

It's as useless in this context as throwing out the aggregate wage gap. It's especially ridiculous when you consider the fact that women are heavily favored in STEM recruitment for college.   Basically I'm saying that women go into lower paying fields than men, work less hours, prioritize career less, prioritize earnings less, and prioritize happiness more. All of that is quantifiable as long as you take respondents at their word. I'd love to hear a counter argument instead of you just throwing out the fallacy fallacy all day.
accountability isn't a liberal principal. 
Specifically what added pork?  What in the bill was unrelated to Hurricane Sandy?
&gt; Nice anecdotal evidence of people who are probably lying to make a point, and assumes that since no one has said they have a 1-bdrm on minimum wage they must not exis  Except here is the thing: anybody familiar with low wage labor in the USA already knows this.  It's easy to tell who works and who does not on these threads, because people will read the article and say, "Well, we don't know that!" No, perhaps not from the data in the article, you don't.  If you had any experience of the real labor market, on the other hand, you would.
Not in my state, but regardless that is idiotic and is only meant to discourage people from carrying.

I don't believe that the Republicans want tax cuts for the rich. Maybe they do, got a link on this?  I'm not aware that the Republicans have a different capital punishment position than the Democrats. Are you certain?  I am a climate scientist that views both as quite ignorant. Have the Democrats called to raise the gas tax by $1 or $2 per gallon?  Politicians take the position that will get them reelected.  The reason that I see both as ignorant is that the United States *still has no plan* to reverse the acceleration rate.  Is there any Republican anywhere that supports more pollution? Link please.  Black lives matter. Look at Baltimore and Chicago, black lives are being lost. So what is the Plan Stan? Where is the vision? These are Americans.  When the Democrats took over the [number of unemployed persons (7.0 million) and the unemployment rate was 4.6 percent.](http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2007/feb/wk1/art02.htm)  [9% of white people and 13% ob black people were below the poverty line](https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/acs-09.pdf)  [According to 2013 ACS data, the proportion of people in the United States with an income-to-poverty ratio of less than 125 percent of the poverty level was 20.6 percent.](http://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acsbr13-01.pdf)
&gt; not one person  I'm actually saying you have *no* real world experience, otherwise you'd understand what real life is like for most people forced to work minimum wage jobs.
maybe, but our top 1% have outpaced the world.
Thats just because, outside of the gop, Americans believe in freedom.
The only reason that intellagent Reddiotors like me and so many others can only get minamum wage jobs is because the 1% greed and there hording money. If it wasnt for that we'd get jobs that pay more what we are worth which is alot because we are actually smart unlike Republicans lol!

King county as a whole is 2 million people. And I know Seattle is more expensive, but the minimum wage is increasing there, and I kind of don't think people who work minimum wage jobs should live in cities anyway.

I live in Jersey, and I was a victim of Sandy. So I'd like you all to join me in giving Ted Cruz a [Jersey Salute](https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi62.tinypic.com%2F2ica6h5.png&amp;t=552&amp;c=dg_CbK-ISEYGGA)
Talk about serious cherry picking.  First, a minimum salary us not supposed to get you the average 1br apartment.  It will get you a pretty shitty one...or a room in an average or better 2,3 or 4 bedroom apartment or house.  You are not entitled to a nice 1br place.  You can spend more of your income on it, or get one after you've moved up the ladder.  Why is it that so people feel entitled to "the average".  Average in and of itself means that half are worse off.  
This is just another day at work for a Republican.  How anyone other than 1%ers can vote for these corrupt, middle-class-killing clowns is beyond me.
So, wasting tax money is not at all like wasting tax money. 
How fitting the reddit liberals in denial don't have a shred of credibility when they don't even admit Obama flip flopped and criticized amnesty for ILLEGAL aliens.  Pathetic
Really? You think rent control laws are what's inflating rent prices in SF? Wow.  Yeah, the tech industry has nothing to do it, it's rent control.
Ezra Klein writes shitty articles for those who are bad at math (numbers-wise and logic-wise).  The minimum wage has little to do with housing costs.  Nominal income doesn't determine how much housing costs.  Doubling the minimum wage, even while freezing all wages above minimum wage, wouldn't make it easier for people to gain housing.   Take a city like San Francisco where the equivalent hourly wage to rent is about $60.  Why is housing so expensive?  Yes, it is difficult to build, but that is not all of it.  San Francisco, like everyplace else people want to live, has a limited amount of space.  Younger more affluent people want to live in cities and they can afford it.  America is becoming more urbanized (and cities are expanding to get more peoples!).  High increasing demand with low constant supply means that prices will be pretty high.  Conversely, rents are much lower in places that no one wants to live.  Check out rustbelt home values and rents.  Cheap as shit.  Increasing nominal income won't solve the problem.  It won't make housing more affordable.  It won't make more housing available.  It won't reduce demand.  It will do almost nothing.  By the bye, kids, we could blame much of this on stupid whitey hipsters that gentrified neighborhoods and kicked out the minorities so they could turn the old butcher shop into a bar and multiple family homes into luxury single units.  edit: I would be somewhat interested to see a poll of the 40% of reddit users that are out of high school.  I would imagine that reddit users are more affluent and responsible for driving up housing costs.  B-b-b-but it is someone else's fault even as we like high home values that keep our neighbors from being scary minorities or people who cannot afford private schools.
Please please please stay true to those principles Rand!
Anti-immigration except for other Cubans. 
More debt. That's how most things are funded.
&gt; I have no idea why landlords believe that poor people won't pay their rent before anything else.  Probably because they've had to evict people for not paying their rent before.
7.25 an hour in Indiana ~$1,000 a month.  There are nice 1 bedroom apartments for $450 a month.
Where should people who work minimum wage jobs in cities live?
Or maybe, just maybe, it could be both
There's more to Seattle than King county. The metro area has 3,671,478 people. The entire state has only 7,061,530. Edit: I live in a suburb of a suburb, and it's still crazy expensive here. 
If no one works at those jobs in the city then those employers would be forced to increase those wages so people will work those jobs. 
How old are you? Sixteen?
Ah.  Investing in an educated populace is a wasting tax money.  Got it.
Ah, when I started to get down voted, I assumed as much. I do agree that the federal minimum wage should be raised and should follow the upward trend of how much shit costs in the US. Prices go up, the minimum wage should follow. I DO NOT agree that a single company, (McDonalds) or multiple companies (any other goddamn teenager job), should raise their own minimum wage simply because their under educated, under qualified, over aged, workers can't afford rent wherever they agreed to live at. Rent and mortgages fluctuate with location. So do how much an individual receives in pay. I'm not going to agree to work at fast food for $7.00 an hour and sign a lease for $1,000 a month and then picket that I'm not getting paid enough. I made those decisions. My first apartment was $545 a month and I had a room mate and we paid the goddamn rent. I worked at a Ryan's Steakhouse and I was never fucking late on rent or any of that shit. I'm starting to get angry and I'm not even subscribed to this sub.. ugh.  *edit. I am subscribed to this sub.

That being said, media companies are in a position to have quite a lot of influence over what's in the mainstream, and it would be a bit ridiculous to think that the people controlling those media companies aren't taking advantage of that.
You can pass the tax but how would you collect it?  If you can either buy a stock on the the US exchange and pay the high tax, or click the other button and buy it on the Chinese exchange, which button will you click?  The tax will not raise any money, got another idea?
Absolutely disgusting.  Teddy Roosevelt is rolling in his grave right now.
Rent control existed before the tech bubble, and is a bigger issue nationwide.

&gt; I was wondering as much, why a "free trade agreement" would require more than a few pages nullifying all protective trade tariffs and restrictions. Just kill the iron curtain and open the borders. That should do it.  Because part of it *is* about regulations which hold foreign companies to a higher standard.  Imagine for a moment if the U.S required French chocolate imports to undergo screening for bug particulate, without forcing U.S companies to do the same.  This would (without tariffs) increase the cost of the French product, and act in the same protectionist way tariffs would.
Wikipedia lists his fields as Physics and Philosophy.      You're right that physicists don't *inherently* understand politics, but it's not much of a stretch to assume a philosopher would.   What's more, a philosopher with so many intellectual achievements that his name has become synonymous with genius.       You'd probably be right if we were talking about Reynman or Curie or even Hawking... but Einstein was on a while different level. 
Watch how he votes. For example, he talks big about how he doesn't like the NSA's spying program on Americans and even does an essentially meaningless filibuster of a bill that [did nothing to affect the senate schedule](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2015/may/20/rand-paul-senate-filibuster-nsa-spying-patriot-act-live) but a few months ago when he had a chance to actually vote for a bill that would reform the NSA to reduce the kind of abuse that led to what he was "filibustering" he [voted *against* the bill](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/11/19/big-hypocrite-rand-paul-votes-against-nsa-reform).   That's just the most recent example. Basically, most of the time when his rhetoric disagrees with the GoP party line he continues to *speak* his rhetoric but *votes* the party line. In my mind that makes him worse than people like Cruz who are at least open about it when they're going to fuck us over.
Ok, so considering the actual interest rate is around 3.92%, you would argue that a mortgage payment of about $213 a month is too high because you work at Burger King at an age where you have a kid and, presumably no higher education, no other source of income (spouse) and own a house and can't pay the mortgage? 
I think the point is more that Sanders now has the combined (small) support of his own, and Warren's, ardent supporters rather than this being a sign of gaining any momentum, changing any minds, or weakening Clinton's position.
&gt;Which Republican gave our enemies all of our secrets due to gross stupidity?  Except that didn't happen and there's been no proof of that happening.  The last republican president was warned in advance of 9/11 and did nothing.  He knew there were no WMDs and started a war anyway because people were mean to his daddy.    &gt;Which of them may have committed a felony   Rick Perry had advanced notice that Cameron Todd Willingham was 100% not guilty of murdering his 3 daughters with arson because a nationally renowned expert (and something like 7-8 renowned experts since) proved that the fire was not arson.  Rick Perry executed him anyway.  He did it for a notch on his belt.  That's first degree murder.  Is that enough of a felony for you?  
well it's pretty simple supply/demand economics, but sure, super fucking retarded. Like, when has lowered demand ever reduced supply right?
No. No you don't. Clearly, you have too many brands of deodorant in your life. Bernie says too many consumer choices only confuse the disregarded masses. It's no different with education. On school, one class, one lesson should surfice.
I live in a one bedroom and share it with my boyfriend who actually has a decent job. Cheapest I could go, live 5 miles from campus. I make $9 in a southern city with low cost of living and I couldn't afford rent by myself. 
Here is the only logical solution,  lower the individual/family fee, for everyone. The internet would not exist except for individuals paying taxes for decades of research and deployment for not only the internet but the marvelous devices to use it.   The access fee should be minimal for every citizen for obvious reasons including it is now not merely important, we are dependdent upon it.    The for profits don't need more tax money they would not have this to use without tax money that created it and both the cable companies and the telephone companies had to be bribed with tax money and bullied into participation.    Now they think they own it.  We, the people built it.  It is ours.

There wasn't much pork in the Sandy aid bills, not compared to other bills:  https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/41/text  https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/152/text 
Are they not tax payers? 
I don't know about that, Bernie Sanders is the one looking to bring back the tax percentages of the 50's.
So you also believe your anecdote applies to the whole country? What if you live in a different town, in a different state? Do people seriously believe no one can afford an apartment making minimum wage? How much is the rent in the cheapest place you could find?
Fox News showing bias in what they air.... No, never.
Bernie can't win, so you must find a way to take him seriously anyway.
Politicians take way too much credit and get way too much blame for short term economic issues.  Making ridiculous promises is jus tpar for the course.  After all, it won't matter.  There is always someone to blame and political team matters more than actual results.  Americans are dumb.  Reddit proves it.  Emotional dullards will ignore the bad and focus on the good, even if the person in office isn't responsible for it.
Well a real fox preys on "birds and small mammals like squirrels, rabbits and mice. A large part of the red fox's diet is made up invertebrates like crickets, caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles and crayfish." . That list of animals is a pretty good metaphor for the Fox News audience.
It must be molestation or rape if it was worth $3.5 million to keep it a secret. What else would be that bad for his career?
You're missing the point
I don't actually advocate raping anyone, but if having sex is enough of a crime that women should be forced to keep babies, surely agreeing to be Scott Walker's lifelong sexual partner is as great a transgression that nullifies innocent status.
Not for nothing but wasn't Cruz proven correct?  He said that Democrat Lawmakers decided to bulk up the relief bill with Billions (with a B) in spending that had nothing to do with Sandy, that was the only reason he voted against it.  He wanted a better bill with more money going directly to the areas that were destroyed by the storm.  What an evil bastard.  I believe the CBO confirmed that much of the spending was slated for years later and included funding for things never affected by the storm.  By the way, I had friends and family who lost their homes and cars in the storm. But who should I be mad at?  Ted Cruz for telling the truth?  Or the Democrats for trying to use the suffering of these poor people to get their grubby hands on more money to spend on unrelated things?  The bias is strong in these stories.
Fox "News" 
You'll be able to pay rent, but then you get to choose between utilities, food, or transportation.  Only one, mind you.  Sure, there are assistance programs for the food, but if you start to come up and make better than minimum, you won't qualify.
And add to that, the farther suburbs of Milwaukee (basically, the surrounding counties in a few directions) are the reddest part.  Waukesha County (due west of Milwaukee County) infamously went harder for Bush in '04 than any place in the nation outside of Texas.

Damn, no wonder he's so insecure.
&gt; no weapons, no ISIS.  It isn't like the US is the only source of weapons in the region.   And really, the idea that we're somehow "responsible" for everything that happens in the Middle East is kinda how we got knee deep in this shit in the first place.   The US stumbled into Iraq based on the false premise that it was somehow a problem that was our responsibility to solve.  To a far lesser extent Syria was viewed as a country we needed to "fix."   We've certainly exacerbated the problems, but the root of the problems is in those countries and it is their responsibility to sort it all out.
50% income tax rate on the wealthiest would keep 90% of tax rates very low. Our tax rate increases as the rich's decreases. Taxing the rich is how we keep our income tax rate low. 
Does anyone really think it'll stop?
minimum wage people be like "whatever".
Completely wrong. There's a set of apartments up the street from my house that cost 350 per month. In my state a minimum wage job brings you 881 dollars per month after taxes. 
It never has. Multiple bedrooms exist for a reason, roommates, share rent. It's been like that for fucking ever, this isn't new...

Came her to say this. In the suburbs of Salt Lake City which is not the cheapest place in America (cheap but not the cheapest). My gf pays $900 for an above average one bedroom place. Minimum wage would make you 1,100 a month, I'm positive there are places in America that you could not only afford rent but also groceries.

&gt; By providing low-income subsidies, we are continuing the pattern of having society (you and I) pay for the living expenses of working individuals rather than the employer that pays their pay check.    Which is exactly how it should be. You would prefer we have pizza hut be responsible for our society? The notion that a business should be such an expert in human resources in every single market and know exactly what each individual needs... and accommodates it is ridiculous. It's a broken system, and the answer isn't to rely on private business. This is a societal issue that should be handled by our government. That's what we have a government for.

Yup. 40 hours a week on min wage is ~$1100 a month. Plenty of apartments in Texas for under 500 a month. Learn how to cook and you can easily live off 150 a week for everything else.  That's also if you refuse to get roommates.
I'll reply to yours since I'm in about the opposite end of the spectrum as Seattle, which is oddly enough where I want to move when I can manage it. Please don't take this as arguing, just pointing out to others that may be reading that this IS a problem in certain areas.  My place next year (just signed the lease last week) should be about $500 a month including utilities. The minimum wage in Oklahoma is $7.25, so federal minimum.  I am not able to get another job due to school and whatnot, since my boss is really awesome about letting me get things done. School &gt; work is a rare thing in my situation, since my schooling at this point is done on a basis of, "Oh shit, I have to go do a lesson right now" with almost no notice.  Right now I'm paying $7800 a year for rent, have been for the last 2 years. Last year I made 75% of my rent ALONE.  The new place with lower rent, with my current job, would barely be covered by my earnings of 2014. Although hopefully by fall I should be completely finished with school and can at least make a little more than I do now, despite my career path being on the underpaid side like too many others.  I can safely say, that without help from my parents, I may not be able to survive and continue studying to do what I love. I would probably be stuck working multiple jobs and in a major that I despise, just to live, if I were in college at all.

Key words *average 1 bedroom apartment.* I happen to know someone who rented his 1 bed apartment whilst working minimum wage, and has since worked his way up in pay and is still renting it. Note: this is not a low-income-support apartment.
We're fucked.  But maybe the next generation won't be, and that's important.
Agreed. I like a lot of his policies but I've said this elsewhere, as president, you need to build a coalition to get stuff done. Bernie has never been a Democrat. He's an independent and I don't think he can build a coalition around his ideas. Hillary has served in the Senate and the State Department. She knows her way around things and can get stuff done. I understand the want for a "Washington outsider" but I don't think an "outsider" can get things done in a crunch.

You're being selfish.  "I got mine, and I had to walk uphill in the snow both ways" nonsense.  
I've seen apartments for less than 100$ a month before. Were they nice? No, should you lock your door and secure your valuables in your anus? Yes, but it was better than the street. Had a toilet and shower (communal), and a microwave and fridge, came with a twin sized bed too.
Its your home, you should be spending half your check on it. You probably spend most of your time there and its by far the most expensive thing that you absolutely NEED.
You don't have to be able to afford college, you just have to ask for a loan.
Wow, what an unbiased and totally fair title!
The standard measure doesn't make as much sense for minimum wage owners. It seems obvious that as people earn less, they will spend a larger portion of their income on living expenses including rent.
Why should Walmart be able to pay their workers less than their workers can survive on, so that the tax payer has to pick up the slack?  This is indirect welfare for billion dollar corporations, and it's a nightmare for liberals, for libertarians, for anyone who isn't a corporatist pig.
So you're saying this is an editorialized title to get upvotes from the predictable crowd of /r/politics? Who would've known!
So in your world, grocery stores, gas stations, coffee shops, and retailers wouldn't exist in cities. Or the only ones that did would be ones like Whole Foods, because the only way to make any money would be to inflate prices. 
Fuck em.
Damn, this thread is just reply after reply of good and valid points. Well done, internet.
What about foreign laws against murder and theft? All you need to do is show that some foreign country has a law against something and now it's illegal for them to enforce it. 
Holy shit!  That was... refreshing.
Oh really? I suggest you look into "wage slave"
Most public colleges are already deeply discounted for in state residents.  This is just a continuation of that tread. 
Which would be half of your pre-tax income on minimum wage...
most businesses in san francisco do not employ many if any minimum wage workers. Most tech companies the lowest paid employee is the secretary at the front desk who probably makes 40k. Even at that salary you cant afford a 1 bedroom apartment in the city. Even if you make 100k you cant afford a 1 bedroom apartment as the average price is 3500 a month currently for a one bedroom in san francisco.
What do you mean he "actually wants to serve and represent the people"? Sanders and Cruz both have political goals, and they both would like voters to share those views at least enough to get them in office.
I've started to expect nothing less from this sub. It's only going to get worse as the 2016 election draws closer and closer. 
Good for him.  Right side of history.
Sadly some Americans wish that every minimum wage workers will just vanish, and be replaced by immigrants.
So, "any publicity is good publicity" is campaign policy?
It's not possible to have a conversation about policy when you are attacking basic ideas like "taxes are, in principle, not theft/slavery/whatever the current Paul Ron meme is."
I guess I shouldn't complain when good things happen for lesser reasons. Now, if we could figure out how to get vengeance out of our legal systen, that would be cause to dance in the streets. 
It's selfish to say "I had it this way, and if anyone gets a better deal in the future I will cry about it and it's wrong."  I am in serious student debt, and this wouldn't help me.  I wish it had been around for me, but it wasn't, and I still would support it.  I don't like Bernie's proposal for paying for it though, sounds bad for people trying to save for retirement, and it's a flat tax, so it's a regressive tax, but in principle I'm for socialized higher ed.
This is misleading. I know a place right now where it's $300 a month.
Fuck that shit. I'm sitting here paying my loans off working hard and some dumb worthless fucks might get to go to college for free and waste it partying.
&gt; No, I'm not interested in hurting the rich. I'm just not interested in my tax money subsidizing bad practices from businesses, and not paying a living wage is a bad practice.    We have a welfare system that we pay for with our taxes. That's why it exists. Just because the progressives just came up with some imaginary goalposts doesn't change reality, nor is it even a smart move. You tax money will be subsidizing a shitload more when Walmart shuts their doors. 
How many ex-speaker Republicans have been indicted at this point? There's Tom Delay, now Hastert, probably Boehner down the line....
It's a bad article. I've lived in apartments that I could afford on ~60 hours a month at minimum wage. That's 15 hours a week. It wasn't even the cheapest apartment in the area. At 40 hours a week or 160 a month, that's enough for food, utilities, and transportation. There are a lot of places in America where you can live on minimum wage — the only places you rally can't are large cities.
My wife and I are childless by choice. I'll take the cash. 
You don't deserve your own place if you only make minimum wage. You get roommates and you do your best to get by. Minimum wage is minimum life...I don't care if people can't get anything better after after their degree. If you can't do better, it's your own fault and that's a fact.
**Hilliary's Libya Debacle**  Hillary authorized the Iraq War and she was in charge of Libya.   Which was the bigger blunder?
Dunno where you live, but I live in the DC area and could easily do that for 1,000
This is a horrible idea, who is going to pay for it, free to someone doesn't mean its free in general
Ok, thanks for clearing it up so I understand for the future.
Cut income tax rate maybe?
Hillary is going to do whatever her PR, marketing and polling teams tell her to do as per the popular opinion of focus groups. 
&gt;It's selfish to say "I had it this way, and if anyone gets a better deal in the future I will cry about it and it's wrong."  There's a difference between "having it better but still earning it" and "having it better and having it handed to you" though. Technology is way better than it was 20 years ago, but people still pay for it.
We don't and we're terrified. 
I will Do everything in my power to make bernie sanders president. I live in Ohio and will vote for him regardless of party. 
There are fewer than 3% working for minimum wage.
The whole thing is just about getting you to vote. Think about it, Saunders *knows* that the Republicans will never pass this. He is lying, they all do it.  We have 40 million with no access to health care. We need to deal with this first.
That's impressive! Where I live (Bay Area, California) I would be losing money if I were on my own and paid minimum wage.
The Democrats are going to win in 2016 and there's pretty much nothing anyone can do about it.  The only way of increasing Republicans' chances from 0% to 1% is for them to pick a minority candidate like Rubio or Carson (Rubio would be better because Hispanics would be easier to 'convert' than black people). Either way it's not going to matter.
That's fine but that's not what he's proposing. As long as from a government benefit perspective both gay and straight "unions" are recognized as equivalent.
He's not gonna be president. Neither is Bernie Sanders. Sorry, Reddit. Make campaign finance reform happen before suggesting a wacky candidate like this. 
Did he inherit a billion dollars?  No?  Thank you.  Did he turn his inheritance into substantially more than a billion dollars?  Yes?  Thank you.
This is an unfair argument to make. These senators, regardless of whether you like them or not, voted down the other bills because they included other things not related to the relief. They had no problem with relief, just the unrelated add ons.
Great question. To be honest, I have nothing specific to point to because these riders are never anything significant as individual items. But here and there would be things such as federal money for subsidizing public school text books, for example. They are usually so that a Congressman can say that he/she did "this, that, or the other. "
Everyone who is thinking this would create a better educated populace would be wrong though.   &gt;Universities will adopt stricter standards because of an increased pool of applicants based on merit rather than who can afford it.  Like this isn't already the case? You are aware that statistically richer people can afford tutoring, test prep and all sorts of other things that make them more "meritorious" than other students, right? This isn't some you pop-out-of-the-womb and have talent regardless of your station in life type situation.   This will do almost do nothing. People already jump over the "affordable" huddle with student aid and student loans - we literally have to pretend none of that exists for your comment to make any sense.

You're dealing with liberals there is no logic
You really think a wall along the entire Mexican border would do anything? We already put a desert there, that didn't work.
Its entitlement that they believe the government owes them shit even if they offer no value
I'm not sure how what should be basic life skills could possibly do anything negative to the market.   Money management? Market killer by golly.  Maintaining a good debt to max credit ratio and being capable of making monthly payments on time? Worst EVVVVEERRRR  You might have to elaborate a bit here buddy.

It's possible he's lying.  But, until he is proven to have lied, there's no reason not to take him at his word.  No one is saying they're going to vote for him RIGHT NOW BECUZ HE IS SO GUD WIF MONEY
Don't count on it.   Sure they won't monitor your "phones". But the law said nothing about not monitoring "Smartphones". 
And why is that? Because the ACA fucked up the work week.
Really doesn't distance himself from most of the competition.
I'm not sure where the confusion here is. Could you spell it out for me?
You're right, the cost should be so high that no others can attend college therefore you get all the jobs.  You just fixed the economy, grats!
Don't give the politicians any more ideas! It's bad enough as it is.
Well regulated by a reactionary, slow bureaucracy I'll-suited to deciding which degrees are worthwhile and which aren't. Fun.
Great.  After I already paid my way through.
No, YOU have it backwards.  Having a degree now doesn't mean much other than you have the ability to pay.  If that opportunity to get your same degree expands to everyone, and only a limited number will be available... Guess what, then it will truly mean something.  People with the talent, but not necessarily the means to attend are now your competition.   
Lovely idea but never going to happen.
That would really only affect your portfolio if you are a high frequency day trader. I know of no 401(k) plans that are managed that way
How can you attack IAWL?  And they say everyone *else* is fighting a war on Christmas... 
The writing in this leans strongly liberal.  I lean liberal but prefer to hear/read unbiased articles (or two, equally biased articles, one from each side) before choosing what I believe.  Anyone have any articles written about the comparison between these two states from the conservative side?
Until the cartels blitz through.  Then they will need the help of the US which is awfully similar to needing federal relief for the floods.
On the issues, Bernie Sanders blows them all out of the water.
Yes, it actually means "payed for with higher taxes."  You're not being clever or adding anything.
Lobbying is fucking legal bribe, it boggles my mind it is allowed in the US.
One wonders if this was Reagan's ultimate plan way-back-when...that evil fuck.
I don't know anyone who does vote for them, aside from a couple nutters I went to high school with - the extreme religious homeschoolers. Vote fixing, no other explanation for such fucking insanity. There just cannot be THAT many dumbfucks. 
how so? 
Another bullshit title from r/politics.
It is generally property taxes, which might have been his point, but even that makes no sense because not everyone with property has kids in the public schools...
Again, selfish as fuck.  It's about the people as a whole, not you and yours.
But a lot of white collar jobs are now being outsourced (a LOT to India), its not just blue collar jobs.  What's crazy is this country is desperately in need of an overhaul of our infrastructure - now is the perfect time for a new "New Deal".

thank you rand paul
That's why I said "this country and Fox viewers"  I imagine that Democrats wouldn't see much difference between them because it's not their party. But Republicans aka fox viewers should.  
Yes, our system is wonderful for rich kids from China.  Not so much for the average American.
We need the cops more than they need us. They can all get other jobs and we can't get any more cops.
But Fox viewers weren't the ones that had anything to do with the polling numbers, except in the most indirect terms, and even then, would only be a very small minority of the people polled.  On a good night, Fox News is only pulling like 5 million viewers or whatever.  That's a small number compared to the number of Republicans or Americans as a whole.  I haven't researched the polling data, so I'm not sure if they were only asking Republicans these questions, or if it was anyone who answered the phone.
[deleted]
Rubio isn't terrible. He's just conservative so Reddit no likey.
They would get more students 
Does this change any of of the point I was making? Or are you just being argumentative 
While I agree with your point, I'm curious if you've backed it with some reasoning or if you just doubt that  any Republican could win just because you disagree with them. (I genuinely want to know, not trying to be an ass. I can link you to one of my comments in a different thread if you want to see my analysis).
Orwellian is frequently used (as I did) to refer to "doublespeak" because Orwell created it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak  Specifically it is used to refer to trying to change how people think by simply changing the words used. So by trying to tell people that a trade agreement isn't a trade agreement this person is trying to win converts with semantics instead of addressing the actual issue under discussion.
Yea because when you're busy trying to pay off your debt and still have enough to cover basic costs of living, it's hard to be altruistic. Not everyone can afford to pay for the next generation and I don't think that's greed talking.
World's tallest midget.
underage boy 
Not to say the guy isn't crazy - the first three are batshit crazy, and I don't doubt he's a terrible candidate - but the fourth one is a comparison to the way people speak out against a coming force.  He wasn't really doing anything comparing the Dem's to Nazis, just about the way people react to a growing power (unless there's more of the statement this quote didn't capture).
&gt;Public colleges  State schools would be part of this, not looney bin schools. We can call Liberty University a "public college" but that's not where the distinction will be drawn.
Yes.  No.
And then we have...a bunch more people with degrees. Whatever degree you hold will be less special, because the poor guy in the trailer right out of high school now has one along with the knowledge and experience from college. This is of course provided the school doesn't drop its standards during its expansion.  I suppose employers will need to find a better method of choosing candidates rather than simply flicking all the degreeless folk into the bin. You'll need to compete. Scary.
I went to UW-Madison for a year and a half... equally big waste of time.
Just like 2012
he is running specifically so that Hillary can move left
The future looks bright baby. Happy for you Americans, doing good things. As much as change sucks major dick, its still a necessity and probably not as horrible as you had imagined. Best of luck!
is it comment first, research second or research first, comment second, I can't remember. 
It's amazing how Rand has gotten zero credit in the media for his actions against the Patriot Act.
&gt; If the laws change to tell them to stop it, they're going to stop.   HAHAHA! Sometimes I wish I was as naive as you sound.  A lot of what they're doing is flat out unconstitutional... yet they continue to do it and lie about it, as the world turns.  Edit: Check out the USA Freedom Act. They're just going to have the telecom companies hold that information for them and hand it over upon request.   And while I agree that many folks at the NSA are just working schleps, the people in charge are out of control.  Seriously, next thing you'll believe is that the Wall St won't blow up the economy again.  Edit2: The best defense/prevention against this type of behavior (both Wall St and the NSA) is to throw those responsible in jail.
Water, Internet, Prisons, EDUCATION... you name it. Here's a good piece: http://www.commondreams.org/views/2013/08/05/8-ways-privatization-has-failed-america  Think education is expensive because of the government? Private schools are what's inflating the cost, and all those lecherous student loan companies are very eager to give out loans because kids can't afford school anymore.   A transit example - Look at Los Angeles. It's very expensive to get around there due to decades of interest groups slowly chipping away at public transit, to the point where you HAVE to get a car to be able to get to many places. Expansions of public transit to reach more places were stupidly voted down by LA's own citizens many years ago because it would have amounted to a tax increase. Instead you just spend way more to get around on your own "private" system of transit.  Water... just look at the things Nestle is doing. And people still spend $2 on a bottle of water they already pay taxes for.   Let's not even start about health care, where the U.S. spends way more per capita on care than the next highest country in the world. Elsewhere in the world, costs are lower because of single-payer gov't funded systems.  Still think privatization isn't more expensive?  
Ron Paul never had a "very clear shot" of winning the republican primary. You people need to get out in the real world, these candidates are no where near as popular or well known as they are in your little internet world. 
Oh certainly, I agree with you on that. I was just answering the question.
Let me get this straight.  TPP is completely secret (Obama claims it isn't) so nobody has actually seen it.  So some random website writes an article about and gives a definition.  How can you define something you've never seen or read?  And by that same token how can anyone possibly tell us what it isn't?
He did on the Daily Show
Honestly.. 1% is probably a better chance of winning than Bernard does the Democratic primary.
&gt; If a company has something to sell, but nobody to buy, then it has no income and therefore cannot hire employees. On the flip-side, if a consumer wants a product/service that isn't yet available, a market is formed where a supplier creates said product/service. Employees are hired in this market, viola, job creation.  sigh...you've just described the basic economic concept of supply and demand.  Consumers don't create jobs...producers do...but producers can't create jobs if there are no consumers to buy their product.  You were right the first time and then mucked it up.  It's a symbiotic relationship.  You should have stuck to that.  ---  And thanks for the link, although it most certainly wasn't Trump himself who said it.  Apparently he had some staffer on auto-pilot retweeting what supporters were saying to him.  Embarrassing, yes, but not something he'd have to directly answer for.
Guys both your parties are completely bought out, all you are doing is jerking each other off...
It is symbiotic, but it STARTS with the consumers. If anybody should be subsidized, it is the consumer base. In our economy today, where gains are privatized and losses are socialized, the working class does not have as much leverage as it should. Also, I understand simple supply and demand, economics was my life in undergrad. 
I just can't help feeling like this is a ruse.   They make us pay attention to these provisions and pretend like their expiration is some great victory, but the true surveillance powers are left untouched.   If these were so critical or even often used we would never hear about them much less even have them come up for a vote.   This is about the illusion of choice, the illusion of democracy.

[You don't say](http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2014/05/12/glenn-greenwald-on-the-2016-elections-theyll-probably-have-a-gay-person-after-hillary/)   &gt;Hillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, she’s been around forever, the Clinton circle. She’s a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. She’s surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But she’s going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. It’s going to be this completely symbolic messaging that’s going to overshadow the fact that she’ll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. **They’ll probably have a gay person after Hillary who’s just going to do the same thing.**   &gt;**I hope this happens so badly, because I think it’ll be so instructive in that regard. It’ll prove the point. Americans love to mock the idea of monarchy, and yet we have our own de facto monarchy. I think what these leaks did is, they demonstrated that there really is this government that just is the kind of permanent government that doesn’t get affected by election choices and that isn’t in any way accountable to any sort of democratic transparency and just creates its own world off on its own.**  - Glenn Greenwald
I was waiting for that response all night.  Have an up vote :)

He's a creationist?!?! He's legitimately one of the best neurosurgeons in the world......***AND HE'S A FUCKING CREATIONIST?!?!?!?!***
That's not what he claims. Do you think there's a Democratic conspiracy?
&gt;"By subsidizing the working class, I mean incentivizing corporations to keep jobs here instead of outsourcing them.  It sounds like you're trying to subsidize corporations, not the working class.  That's most certainly how such a proposal would get painted.  That's something the far right would propose...it's a corporate tax break.
You're trying way too hard to tell us you don't like Fox News.
They're not finding a better job. They'd be finding a more affordable place to live. If they can only get minimum wage jobs then the only way to increase their income is to move to a more affordable place (usually outside the city).
I talk down to you, you talk down to me, this is fun! Too bad your "facts" are skewed. He won a plurality in 5 states, which i guess is considered a "good number" now. Ron Paul finished last with ~10% of the popular vote in the 2012 Republican Primaries. You see in most primaries you have a big well known candidate getting a lot of the popular vote. Then you get sort of a secondary candidate challenging the big candidate getting a decent amount of votes. Then you get the bottom feeders who get &lt;20% of the total vote. Ron Paul was just that, and guess what Bernie Sanders will likely be!
That's generally understood to be the meaning of public university - an institution that, irrespective of sources of tuition funds for students, receives funding from a state or federal government. Any private university, including religious ones such as Liberty University, would not fall under this definition. 
If Republicans win the Presidency, you might as well plan to move the fuck out of the US, because Kansas is the future of that party.
Fiorina and Trump are not going to be President. They're just not. Stop giving them the attention. All they do is make money from it.

Rubio is actually quite moderate, especially as far as the GOP goes.  But he's a popular conservative, who's not a libertarian, so as far as /r/politics is concerned, he might as well be part of the KKK. 
I am not a Rand Paul fan in the slightest, and maybe I'm not paying a ton of attention to the GOP primary, but so far, I feel like I haven't seen a non-wacky candidate. Paul is 3% behind all the top tier people. Comparing him to Sanders, who is like 45% behind, smells a bit off to me.
Campaign finance reform isn't really the issue here. America has a strange history of blaming crises and government shortcomings on corporate power, which has merit on much fewer occasions than it is mentioned.  The amount of bureaucracy surrounding elections is absurd, for one. In the electronic age anyone should be able to put their name on a ballot, the screen just keeps scrolling. You shouldn't have to, like in some states, procure 2 million signatures, *on paper*, to prove that your party is substantial. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the bureaucratic nightmare that exists in our government.   The problem isn't that the corporations are controlling the government, the government has become self-sufficient in controlling the population despite their conflicting interests and whatever the population wants.  The government isn't by the people for the people anymore, not when only 36.4% of voters turned up in 2014, and the government has evolved to happily keep out whatever voters threaten the duopoly they have established.   But, if you want to go back to corporate influence in the federal government, the problem isn't that corporations are participating too much in government, it's that the people are participating too little.
I feel like they're just manipulating the polls. Like WHO THE FUCK WANTS ANOTHER BUSH?! Yet he's in the lead......oh god, this country might not make it.
First past the post voting means the majority of American's never vote for the candidate they want.  My parents told me when I was growing up, who I vote for doesn't matter, just choose "The lesser of two evils"  I have never voted for this reason. Because "fucking participating" doesn't get the results I want.
All I can do is hope your elections don't turn out as much of a farce as ours on the uk.
I vaguely recall them saying fair to mean they are helping balance against liberal news.  That is, since so many other channels are liberal, they're fair in that they do conservative stuff.
&gt; We've been screwed over so many times, I have no more faith left.   Hey, I can't fault you for that mentality. Our society has really done a shit job of taking care of the next future generation. We seem to, as a society, only care about what's in it for us. Maybe it will take a generation of people to stand up and be willing to sacrifice for others in order for humanity to take greed seriously. I just don't know. I do know that if Bernie Sanders doesn't become POTUS, I will swear a lot.   Just know that if cancelling your student loan debt is an option that I can vote for, you can count on me. 
Comical satire hardly qualifies as national media.
Honestly, it's apparent and anyone with intuition can see that Bernie Sanders is doing this because he wants to help the country he loves. Somehow he connected to the future when he was a young man and he saw the way that people could be if we want to revolutionize our system of life. And so he's been waiting for the pot to boil, and it's been heating up with the growth of technology and the paradigm shift of the internet, which gave us access to great stores of information.  So now we have the better capacity to see past the smoke screen of people who seek power for themselves and not to help others. Once we accept that sociopaths are drawn towards politics, we can see the cancer growing inside the government. Bernie Sanders is the miracle worker who knew the cure for our cancer before it had metastasized.  He doesn't put on a mask because he genuinely wants to fix our country. The other politicians have to put on masks because they really want the power for themselves.  I should write Bernie Sanders and see if I can help him with his campaign.

You kind of do if you want to be able to diagnose a problem.
\&gt;implying msnbc does reality  hehe
That's a pretty weird reading of that poll! What you're likely seeing is that the most liberal of the four candidates gets a slightly higher portion of the moderate vote (perhaps fiscally conservative Democrats), and that moderates run from the guy who earned his name busting unions. The differences in who is willing to vote for a Republican candidate has a lot less to do with Hillary (who is, you know, a constant throughout this) and a lot more to do with... the differences in the Republican candidates.  And it's all within the margin of error, anyway, so it's curious that you're implying the differences are huge.  Another thing that's a bit odd is that you bring up the "binary government" right after showing a poll mentioning five presidential candidates.
What do the hivemind liberal sheep of reddit care anyway? They've all been conditioned to "vote" for democrats and radical socialist marxist. They're all going to vote for Hillary. She WILL be the nominee for the Democrats.
As a Sanders supporter, I completely agree. Rand Paul seems like the only Republican currently running who isn't a complete sellout.
Is there any limit on the power of the federal government?     If so, what is it?  
Ron Paul didn't win the popular vote in a single state. By some reckoning, he won the USVI, but USVI allows six votes per person and only three delegates had pledged for Romney at the time vs Paul's full slate of six (and each of those Romney delegates did better than any of Paul's delegates). He won second place in 22 territories out of the 55 remaining... hardly "almost always 2nd".   He won a plurality of delegates in only three territories, not enough even for an actual nomination. He won second place in, again, 22 territories out of the 53 remaining. Again, not almost always second, and not a particularly impressive result considering that by that point he was the only other candidate running.  So on what basis did he have "a very clear shot of winning"?
Such cloying sycophantry! Questions:  Why is [stovepiping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stovepiping) bad when Cheney et al did it to justify invading Iraq, but okay with Hillary did it on a regular basis with Sidney Blumenthal's memos?  Why is the appearance of a conflict of interest considered a bad thing for anybody *but* the Clintons?  If we elect Hillary Clinton, is the media just going to suck up to her like this the entire time? If so, then [count me out](/r/AnybodyButHillary)!
Did he just lump gays in with pedophiles and chicken-fuckers?
Because its getting into the run up for the next election we've been invaded by a bunch of conservatives from other boards online trying to steer /r/politics narrative.  Remember all that #standwithrand shit? 99% of /r/politics users would never say that but every thread was full of comments at the top praising rand paul and ignoring the multitude of horrendous policies he supports.  Any time theres an election we get flooded with conservatives trying to force the narrative of /r/politics to a conservative bent, it drives them quite mad that they havent managed it with /r/politics when every opther forum they invaded is now 100% wacko conservative full of comments about jade helm and other insanity.
Can I have free trade school? 
&gt; I hope he wins, even though I identify as a Libertarian (causing me to disagree with more than a few of his stances) I'd still vote for him over any candidate in that picture, or any other Dem candidate that's currently running.  This is kind of how I feel too. I'm not sure I'd vote for him but he is far more honest and sincere about actual liberal priorities than any Democrat I've seen in my lifetime. I think his (and this sub's) opinion on Citizen's United is barking mad, but at this point even that seems like small potatoes compared to things like drone warfare and NSA data collection.   All that being said, the GOP could nominate an actual Hitler Frankenstein and I honestly might still vote for it over Hillary. I just turned 30 and the Bushes and Clintons have already held the nation's highest office for well over half my life. I grew up thinking that dynastic control of the reigns of government is exactly what the voting process is meant to *prevent*. 
[deleted]
I know this will be an unpopular opinion and 99% of the time, I usually side with the Democrat's view, but I actually think the Republicans have a point here.  Congressional districts probably should be apportioned by number of eligible voters/citizens.   Lets take an extreme corner case.  Lets say a congressional district is drawn that is somehow 99.9% illegal immigrants, leaving .1% eligible to vote.  Would I feel comfortable with a congressman who only had to answer to .1% of the people in his district?  I think a congress that has to be accountable to more people would be better  than the tea party kooks that are in congress right now.  
Well? Universal healthcare, eventual bipartisan stimulus package...  I prefer Clinton to Obama but he certainly didn't have a failed Presidency, even if he lost out on certain battles.
Sure they do. There are always old people.
It has been known to happen that young people eventually get older...
Dude.... 
You have been misguided. He was polling over everyone, and they buried him. It is all fixed. Time to do something about it 
&gt; I vaguely recall them saying fair to mean they are helping balance against liberal news.   That's the bullshit their apologists came up with after it was clear FOX was nothing more than the propaganda wing of the GOP.  Never mind there isn't a single liberal network in this nation.  NPR might be the closest, but it's been getting more right wing as it's gotten more corporate. 
You've got my vote.
I'd blame it more on the Sanders phenomenon. They know Sanders is at best a left wing fringe candidate who isn't electable to the general electorate. To counter this they have to take Clinton and distort her record so much so that she could not possibly be the nominee thereby clearing the way for Sanders.  They accomplish this by somehow painting Clinton as a right leaning candidate, beholden to all the same interests, and sharing all the same policy proposals as the undesirable Republican other. Of course this is patently ridiculous, but it persists anyway.   Meanwhile Sanders remains unelectable and our best bet at avoiding a disastrous Republican administration is unfairly undermined by her own ideological brethren.   Election time really is something else.
OP is making the misguided assumption that the young won't become more reactionary as they grow older. But they always have and always will. 
&gt;How has this completely warped idea permeated this subreddit so much?   I think it happened when there was a certain black president at some point who betrayed everything he stood for the day he took office.
But they support gay people. That's practically communism!
Yes many republicans (especially McCain, Graham, and McConnell) wanted to fund the "Syrian rebels", but Rand - so did 0bama, Hillary, Pelosi, Boxer, Reid, etc etc.   Rand, the half truths are not going to cut it for me.  We, as a nation, continually betray our principals for our short term interests.  This isn't a GOP problem, it is a politician problem.
Not for emergency relief it isn't, and certainly not for things that have no bearing on the Hurricane.
Fox is further right than MSNBC is. MSNBC is not left, however. America has no liberal news station (excepting maybe NPR on the outside). America's version of liberal is a tad less right wing of Stalin and a tiny bit less left than Lincoln (because America didn't abolish slavery, we just turned it into an institutional thing), now throw in some Jim Baker for that extra sense of "WTF are they about". Not that Jim Baker should have anything to do with politics, but for some reason Americans gotta have frosted bullshit over plain bullshit, so the more confused the messenger the more we like the message.   The good news is that most of the stations (certainly not Fox) have started a trend towards leaning liberal, but none of them have quite made it yet. They haven't gotten near the quality that existed before Reagan removed the restrictions the prevented news station from sending out politically biased messages. 
Fundies probably love him, and he does have a pretty impressive resume. 
Or just switch Illinois in place of Minnesota for the comparison and draw all the opposite conclusions.
What's wrong with the trump. I think he would make a great president 
whats wrong with being a libertarian ? I come from a communist country ( france) and i believe only having the choice between blue socialists , red socialists, communists and national socialists really puts you down. At least you have a choice between freedom and serfdom. 
I don't think so.
I don't think it will be scandal that prevents Mr. Sanders from presiding over this nation, but it will be his ideas.
To the top with you.
When he says electability he means will Corporate America get behind you. Both Democrats and Republicans are just different wings of Corporate America. Ron Paul would never be accepted by the military/industrial complex or Wall Street. Wall Street because he wanted to audit the Fed.
Originally, Fairey had claimed his HOPE poster was based on a 2006 copyrighted photo of then-Senator Barack Obama seated next to actor George Clooney, taken in April 2006 by Mannie Garcia on assignment for the Associated Press, which wanted credit and compensation for the work.[53]  Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use.[55] Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo.[56] Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.[57]  "Fair use" is determined by how much a new work changes an older one. At first Fairey claimed he used the photo of Clooney and Obama and cropped the actor out of the shot and made changes.  In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.[58]  In October 2009 Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP.  Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama.  Fairey's lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation definitely put Mr. Fairey's case "in trouble".[59][60] In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle.[61] The parties settled in January 2011.[62]  On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for "destroying documents and manufacturing evidence."[63][64]  On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.[65]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey 
  Let's just completely ignore [Bernie sanders](https://berniesanders.com/) Who's polling numbers have doubled in the last 3 weeks and Lets also ignore the Infighting between the [30+ Republican candidates](http://2016.republican-candidates.org/). 
Didn't mean to suggest advocating privatization of the military, just that cutting government budgets isn't simple.  Removing your money from a private entity is. 
Good. I'm sick of that little twat and his minor army of mindless followers. 
I agree with you that those assholes run the GOP, but they don't have total control over the election process. The most they can do is throw infinite amounts of money into different races to influence the outcome.  Judging by the fact that Fox news has been pretending that Rand Paul doesn't exist I'd wager that they don't exactly have him under their thumb like most of the other candidates.   I'm not arguing that a Paul nomination would somehow cause a reworking of the GOP. I'm just saying that not every republican is their bitch. 
If you're implying somehow that Rand would somehow be better than whatever the party offering this election will be, you are nuts. Just because he's an underdog who says nice things about pot doesn't make him good. He would be the near-instant economic death of this country and the biggest presidential disaster since Franklin Pierce. He has no chance and is being 'blacked out' by the evil media because most people aren't dumb enough to fall for his dog and pony show, and see him as the circus candidate he is. Reddit as a whole really needs to take their second-opinion bias and shove it back up their asses.  Yeah, I know, Rand is so *underground*, most people have probably never even heard of him. While that tingles your hipster senses, the reason most people don't give a shit about him or his dad is because they're certifiably crazy. 
Why don't we ask snowden Tha at his next ama
Only leftists would ever believe government control = "free".
You don't know how to read. *Of course* I don't make sense to you.
Hold up. Ron Paul may have "warned" them. But even a broke clock is right twice a day. The problem is that he has been blustering about the Fed for decades, but it wasnt the fed that caused the problem, but the act of congress that *required* banks to give out subprime mortgages. The derivative scheme was just Goldman Sachs way of trying to mitigate the eventual crash that was mathematically inevitable, and making some money off the trading along the way.  Everyone wants to blame the bankers, but it was congress' fault. Bankers alone are so risk averse they would never have given out those mortgages if they hadn't been legally required to. That being said, they do use their money to lobby for shit that is heinous and they are definitely also villains, they just arent the most guilty party in this situation.   But I've yet to hear a single major libertarian politician, or honestly any politician, actually talk about the REAL causes of the crash.  Edit: I do want to say, I LOVE Ron Paul and am a former libertarian myself. Currently I'm pretty libertarian, but I think a more accurate label given the current political climate of this country for me would be liberal, mostly because I've done a LOT of studying into economics and there is no reason that we can't have really good social programs that soften the evils of society for the disenfranchised and still have plenty of incentive for growth, or actually MORE than we have now. On the one hand you need to not take away people's incentives, but on the other hand, if life is too much a struggle for them it becomes impossible for them to build more marketable skills, because all their resources are wasted merely attempting to survive. In fact, one of the reasons we are having a slow recovery is because there are too FEW programs. How are we supposed to produce people worthy of jobs if our education system is so bad that it produces people who have no skills? Do you really think that cutting costs will produce more growth than investment in our human capital? Because every company on the planet would disagree. Apple didnt invent the iphone by cutting costs, they invented it by investing in R&amp;D. We need to invest in our populace and they will produce more, if we just neglect them then they will waste all their resources trying to survive and they will have no resources or time left over to even attempt to thrive.  On top of that, the argument for individualism is wrought with fallacies. There is no such thing as individualism. Individualism is a naked human alone in the woods getting eaten by a bear. Nobody built their company by themselves, nobody could even survive in this world by themselves. We are a network of interlocking organisms that need each other to survive and owe an immeasurable amount to many people around us. It is completely fucking absurd to pretend that someone built ANYTHING by themselves.
Idk, it seems like everyone has been supportive and respectful of the current president regardless of whether they agreed with him or not, amiright guys?  /s
We have thoroughly established that that bill was NOT the needed solution to unconstitutional surveillance  People using that as an example are merely ignoring that fact to conveniently call him a hypocrite  Edit: you can Downvote me if I'm interrupting your circle jerk that badly, but we all remember the /r/politics thread where we collectively realized that that piece of legislation empowered the surveillance apparatus instead of blocking it.  Your memory is like that of a goldfish.  Playing party politics is more important to some if y'all than reality and that's really bad yo 
I distinctly remember protests against the porn ban
Don't even try speaking the truth in r/politics, the people in here are too far gone to help. 
What if Sanders can't beat the Republican nominee?  Clinton can beat him, whoever he is, I have no doubt.  Sanders?
Try blaming some democrats for warmongering in a non-rand Paul thread.  WATCH THE DOWNVOTES FLY  (That being said I agree with you. Hillary Clinton will warmonger like George HW BUSH 4.0 only could)
There is no way you are walking out of a show with a Class 3 device unless you already went through the background check, got your stamp and we're just picking it up.

All I can say is fuck Hillary
Then you can't be a true British Citizen^^^^((TM)^)
Maybe, but not because someone voted against the $60B+ Sandy pork bill, which was jammed pack with spending not related in any way to hurricane damage, or even the NE.  Like $150M for Alaska fisheries.  Or bribes for AL, MS, and LA.  http://nypost.com/2012/12/15/obama-sandy-aid-bill-filled-with-holiday-goodies-unrelated-to-storm-damage/ 
They've justified their disrespect by developing the narrative that Obama himself doesn't respect the office (HE DOESN'T WEAR A SUIT JACKET AT ALL TIMES IN THE OVAL OFFICE!! OUTRAGE!!) so by disrespecting him, they are actually respecting the office that he disrespects. Also, he's ineligible for the presidency because he's a Kenyan.
I'm sorry I don't post often enough for your taste, but please don't do an evil media blackout on me! Whatever will I doooooooooo
With Sid Vicious.
Honestly, the difference between a libertarian and a lefty is that the libertarian has only studied the THEORIES of economics whereas a liberal is more familiar with the REALITIES of economics.  I used to be a libertarian, but the more I studied about how our country and economy really functions and what it would take to fix it the more liberal I became. The simple fact of the matter is that in order to have a populace that produces you have to invest in their human capital. In other words, you need social programs, not ones that just dole out money, but ones that help people to have the opportunity to even get better skills. Beacuse left to their own devices most poor people have to expend all of their resources to barely survive. How are they supposed to pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they have to work two 8 hour a day jobs just to afford housing and food?  That doesnt mean that the right answer is welfare per se, but some social program or law, for example, a living wage law. Again with schools, if we don't equalize school funding then the poor will always remain poor because their schools will simply not have enough funding to be able to teach the students as well as rich kids are taught.  On top of that, there are some pretty glaring philosophical errors in libertarian thinking, for example, the idea of individualism. In reality, individualism is a naked human alone in the woods being eaten by a bear. There is no such thing as individualism. We are an organism that can only survive by working as a team, and literally nothing that you do is something you've done yourself. You may have done a lot of the work, but you simply have not done all of it, period. You couldn't even drive to work in the morning without benefitting from someone else's work. And that's just one example.
American liberal or actual liberal? 
I am a student at Western Kentucky University which is located in Bowling Green,  Kentucky. I was in the same fraternity as Ran Paul's son William Paul. That is before he was arrested and his dad put him on lockdown. Now I was good friends with his son William Paul, or Will Paul, as we all called him. Now when I knew him my freshman year which was 2012-2013 he used to brag about how he got his cocaine from his dad. He used to steal it from the family house and bring it to the parties. Now the cocaine he had was unlike any I've ever had before and by that I mean it was the strongest by a mile. Now I'm not sure if he was blowing smoke up all our asses or he was indeed getting it from his father but I know there was a cocaine scandal involving the family at some point that was swept under the rug. Now I'm sure a lot of politicians partake in the using of cocaine but from the stories I heard from Will Paul his dad was a guy who always had a lot on him at any given time. Now I know I'll probably be down voted for this but I feel it's a relevant piece of information about the guy. I can't prove that he said these things because we didn't video tape but I can prove I was friends with him and a couple of my best friends roomed with him while he was at WKU until his arrest in Charlotte Airport when he was high on cocaine and drunk as shit. Which daddy of course got him out of. Now I've met Mr. Paul on several occasions through William and he has always struck me as a politician and nothing more but I feel  people should know what I know about the family.   
Tom Wheeler has gone from a ['dingo babysitter'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU) to one of my favorite government employees.  
He was arguing with bernie sanders about whether or not someone who earns a medical degree should be forced into work by the government.   Government forcing you to work *is* slavery. 
Is disaster relief really big government?
Thanks obama
So wait, it's legal to search Americans who haven't left the country without a warrant or even probable cause? How quickly we are turning into a totalitarian state.
That is only partially true. While most *people* in general form their ideas mostly from bias and assumptions, that does not mean that there is not sufficient data for serious people to develop very real and effective theories.  There is a reason that we teach keynesian and not classical economics in serious universities. There is TONS of data. Literally there are fucking mountains of it. There is a very real reason that you only find serious libertarians OUTSIDE of academia, with the exception of only two schools, and that is because the evidence is so blindingly clear. Just like how you can find a couple of professors that say that global warming is false, you can find a couple who are die hard classical economists, but for serious and honest intellectuals the preponderance of data is absolutely staggering.  At this point there is nearly a full century worth of evidence.
Is there anything about our policing system that isn't broken?  It doesn't make any sense for us to pay for their over-eager trigger fingers or their "mistakes". They should have to pay damages through insurance or other methods that any other American would have to go through.
In all fairness Kansas doesn't have a lot going for it in terms of resources/tourism like Colorado does so thats not exactly a fair comparison.  I don't think even a dem governor and legislature could turn Kansas around.
Why wouldn't he be able to? A paper bag should get more votes than one of those crazy bigots 
you know, rand paul is wrong on so many different issues but even a broken clock is right twice a day.
that's the joke.jpg
Great quote.  Yeah the most troubling thing to me is how Republicans don't realize that the main villain of Atlas Shrugged IS THEMSELVES. It's James Taggart, the capitalist who uses money to try and corrupt the government system for his own benefit.  That and the fact that Rand was far more critical of religious people than she was of democrats. And why? Because religious people eschew reason. Ayn Rand was chiefly a proponent of reason, her libertarian-like political philosophy was only incidental to her deeper philosophy, that of reason.  To me it's one of the clearest signs that most republicans don't really study anything at all, nor do they engage in critical thinking. Because had an appreciable number of them actually read and thought critically about the messages in the book then they either would change their philosophical and political opinions, or they would stop endorsing her work.  I personally think that Ayn Rand was a very brilliant intellectual who had a lot of really good points. I think that she missed the boat in a few places though. Really that's how I feel about all libertarians. They are people who are close to the right answers, but just have a few logical flaws in their thinking. Actually, if you want to go real deep, that's how I feel about pretty much ALL philosophers. Everyone approximates truth, I've yet to find anyone who captures it.
&gt; Not saying that's why Cruz voted against it.  Based on his statement when he voted against it, that was exactly why he voted against it.   By his accounting 70% of the money in the bill was not emergency relief spending. To my mind that is really a two-fer for sleaziness on the part of the senators and congressman loading up the bill with pork. Not only are they sneaking unrelated crap or at best non-urgent/non-emergency stuff into a bill which is fast-tracked and (almost) impossible to vote against. But it is also lying to the victims of the storm "We authorized $10 billion dollars to spend on your relief" but it's really only $3 billion plus $7 billion of other crap.
It's more than that. On several very important issues he's so very wrong. Shame he's batshit crazy about other things.   
Yeah, it was social pressure...and if gay couples are socially pressured to marry we must block them because...gov out of marriage!
I've seen this stupid ass saying on like 9 Rand Paul threads.  Please say something of substance or just go away???
It's clearly GWB's fault
Wages were stagnated well before NAFTA
I would love to see a 2016 race between Sanders and Paul.  The conversation could be so different from what we're used to.
You realize he provided no links because hes lying to you right?
As much as I can't stand Jeb, his family knows how to skirt the rules for monetary gain. Saying "I'm not running" while building a money-pile with which to fund his campaign is as dirty and foul as it is smart.
To be fair, the support for segregation is directly out of his anti-government stance. Desegregation was instituted from the top down by judges and legislatures. Segregation was a bottom-up idea pushed by scared and racist white folks from the community.  It's the same logic he uses to say "fuck gay people if they don't already live in a progressive state". He wants to let the states keep their discrimination and their assholery until THEY decide it's time to change. So, for example, Mississippi still would have anti-miscegenation laws and Alabama would have just barely repealed them (or not, since public opinion probably changed in part due to the Loving V. Virginia decision "forcing" Alabama to have mixed-race marriages). And, if you're a gay kid growing up in the Deep South, you shouldn't have protections against housing discrimination, employment discrimination, etc. until your state decides to implement those.  The hypocrisy comes when he talks about abortions. The government legislating that a woman must give up ownership of her body to a fetus (or, since it is legislated, to the State) for the duration of her pregnancy is the opposite of the "small government" credo he professes. It removes personal freedoms in terms of your own body, a pretty intense violation for Paul to overlook.
I've seen it stated as for MS and Alaska, or just "several states".  Pork is spending outside the intent of a particular spending bill.  IMO it's never financially responsible.  The earmarks are usually added to bribe congress people from u affected geographies to vote for the bill.  It's just a bad way to govern.
You apparently only read the first half of my post.
Having lived in Minnesota my whole life, can confirm, that everyone needs to get aboard the Minnesota karma train.

Awesome strawman debunking! Come on be honest most libertarians including Ron and Rand still want a government for regalian functions : interior safety : police and justice  external safety : army currency  If you like socialism you are either a parasite or a thief . 
There are that many dumbfucks.   But there are more moderates &amp; progressives that are not dumbfucks, but THEY DON'T VOTE. The crazy people are motivated &amp; vote in every election. 
&gt;but... y'know. Wyoming.  Good public schools, low crime, and lot's of nature?
By "WRONG" You mean doesn't agree with you.
I'd pay to see that happen.
He's into the typical small government crap aka fewer regulations, more liberty for corporations to fuck us and the environment.
It almost seems like the delightful portion of the Republican mantra of deregulation might be somewhere between mildly unhelpful, to disastrously bad.  Who knew?
When the republicans move left on social and foriegn policy issues its gonna be a real hard time for the Democrats.  
They're just upholding the fine tradition of paying more than they have to for something, in order to deny someone getting it "for free".
     $3.5 million ? The amount of money for 'silence' boggles my mind.

So long as it's not controlled by the government it'd be an improvement on today. The idea that a commodity money would be preferable is neither crazy nor that uncommon. Officially the US has only been off of a gold standard for about 43 years.
Probably the ideals where he says the GOP hawks are responsible for ISIS.
That's a 2 year old draft... It's been long changed
He was in the House until 2007, he started paying off whoever it was in 2010. There seem to be rumors the reason for the payoff happened before he was elected, so you'd be still right, it never disturbed him even though it should have. But if the rumors are false and this happened after 2007, then it's irrelevant to his tenure, no matter how much I dislike him.
He's crazy on some issues, but the thing is I *like* him. I don't agree with him, but he seems like an alright guy. Much better than some of the fucking psychopaths he's running with.
Oh yes, those famous Nixon block grants that effectively killed the anti-Poverty program but did provide lots of cash for friendly for profits to pass back to electing the "right" kind of lawmakers.   The poor got vouchers but no housing, no education/job training.
Again double standard can be seen here in r/politics.  Romney didn't do anything stupid there.  Where as Sanders the anti American fantasizes about criminal acts against women.  
All of the people downvoting you are hypocrites, that's for sure. 
The principles are quite similar to most FTA's so they didn't particularly said anything people who study FTA's didn't expect.
There were more jobs created from November 2014 through February 2015 than Bush's entire 8 years so yes, thanks Obama.
You're getting in the way of the jerk.
I'd prefer President Bush to President Paul.  But that's like saying I'd rather have my head crushed slowly in an automatic log splitter than be eaten alive from the inside by rats.
They have their "First War,"  The war against our twice elected with a strong majority by U.S. Citizens President Obama.    The "War to stop Obama" is the only war plan the Republicans have,   oops except they seem to want to nuclear bomb the entire Muslim world back to the stone age.    *fist/first.
I was answering the guy's question.
What if they ended up forming a presidential ticket?
Here's a voice of reason, a judge has just said that they had no legislative authority to begin the program in the first place, so Mr. Reasonable, do go on and tell us about how the NSA cares so much about laws. So much so, that the very program you are alleging they will shut down in adherence to a law, was started up *in violation of the law*.  "Yeah these guys will totally follow the law with this program, excluding it's entire history from the second of its inception. I mean, what reason to we have to not trust them, aside from *the entirety of our experience*? Listen to a voice of reason!"
&gt; The principles are quite similar to most FTA's so they didn't particularly said anything people who study FTA's didn't expect.  Indeed. Good for the companies and industries on the [Industry Trade Advisory Committees](http://ita.doc.gov/itac/committees/) and everyone else can get lost.
Well a lot of right wing big business owners and the chamber of commerce are flooding the country with illegal aliens bro. Cheap labor. You guys are so cute with your Obama hatred.
Yeah I'm calling bs on that one. Econ 101 is a more general non-keynesian but the more you do the more keynesian it tends to get.   Highly doubtful that you're not lying.
The queuing caught my interest, but the fish and chips caught my attention.
So you'd prefer to only be able to buy goods made in your home country?
Half of the costs go to private insurers to cover their admin costs and profit. This just tells me we need to go to single payer. 
Obama's already killing ISIS leaders, an organization created by GW's insane war, led by former Iraqi officers, armed by Iraqi troops that ran.   Gay marriage! Abortion! Contraceptives! Benghazi! 
&gt; Having a porous lawless national border does NOTHING but harm Americans, especially the poorest American citizens.   Huh, just a moment ago it was OBAMA IS FLOODING THE NATION WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. Now its just generic and baseless conservative lies about how the border is porous and lawless?  Alright, I'll bite.  1. How is the border "lawless" when the sum total of deportations and removals are at a historic high? 1. Given that people cross the Korean DMZ and crossed the East/West German border, both of which were mined and had sentry guns, what exactly are you advocating for here and how is it a realistic goal? 1. How, precisely, does immigration hurt poor Americans?  1. Why should I believe conservatives give a shit about poor Americans?  &gt; But it does expand the liberal base.  You do know that illegal immigrants can't vote, right?  But yes, I suppose that's true in a roundabout way. When your party supports xenophobic nationalism, it isn't hard for the party that doesn't to look real good.  &gt; In the end that's all that matters to obama and leftists: more government control.  Walk me through that thought process, would ya?  First you assert the border is lawless.  Then you assert this expands the liberal base.  Finally you assert that turns into more government control.  So once again I return to my original question: *Have you been drinking?*
This stupid social justice circle jerk does not address the underlying problem of the non-elected federal reserve manipulating the money supply to meet the needs of big banks.

It shouldn't be 40k. That's the point. Also I don't mean soul searching, but a Platonic development. See Robert Hutchin's writings for the philosophy of higher education. Or Andrew Delbanco.   I admit 40k is absurd, so the point is it shouldn't cost 40k. 
Sure, we are now to believe this organization funded by the conservative libertarian billionaires is now all cuddly and looks with loving kindness on African American women.

Not hit by a plane, but rubble from a collapsed building hit by a plane. That was also the reason for the fire that engulfed the entire building as well as fatally compromising it's structural integrity. But hey, let's keep ignoring facts, and perpetuate some stupid idea that it was a controlled demo.   I'll sit and wait for more YouTube videos of armchair engineers and shoddy 911 Truther sites as that is always how these threads go. 
The movement is out out of new ideas and mostly about rehashing older ideas while still trying to grow which is pretty difficult.  It means that the new ideas tend not to be coming not from the center but from the far end of the spectrum.  They also need to retain support of the coalition they built up since the Reagan era at a time when the nation is tired of war and has not seen much benefit or the promised growth from past tax cuts.  Last, you have a crowded field thanks to the amount of campaign money out there but little to differentiate yourself as a candidate on.  This also tailors the message to the extreme end to win the primary.  One final comment is democrats need a message that people can get behind instead of just attacks on the right.  The wedge social issues will keep many voters picking extreme Republicans over any liberal until there is some real issue they can get behind besides social issues.  I don't know what that message is, but I'm sure it is probably not going to be Wall St approved which does present issues for the current state of the left.  Until they find it, I expect a continuance of extreme right views holding onto enough of the government to keep people like the Duggar family in a position to shape the debate more than those who attack them without ideas of their own.
Texas Loses Billions To Treat The Poor By Not Expanding Medicaid, Numbers Say

The first quarter of the newly elected Republican majority in both houses of Congress.    Way to go Republicans!
Supposedly he opposed the Hurricane relief because there was so much pork (money for unrelated things that politicians tried to get passed as part of the same bill).  
In theory I agree with you, however the fact that the right has not adapted to the economic/social realities of modern America. Maybe if any of them were actual original thinkers I might root for them to get the nomination. 
lol what.
Thinking something should be regulated and hating it are VERY different.  Do you think factories should be able to dump toxic waste into our public water supplies? No? So you hate productivity? (If your answer is yes, it terrifies me that people like you exist.)  Do you think private citizens should be allowed to fly a plane without lessons or taking a test to show their competence? No? So you hate freedom of travel?  In short, you are operating under a false dichotomy of either something should just be allowed with no oversight or regulation, or you hate it.
Go Bernie Go!  
I really don't understand how the GOP can whine about "foreign governments buying influence" through the Clinton foundation, then support the "Citizens United" ruling which does the exact same friggin thing.

Was that $3M from insider info on where the highway would be built or did he actually cause legislation to build the highway over it?  Or was it dumb luck and he happened to own the land and the highway placement had nothing to do with it?  If he caused the land to be bought by being in Congress, that has to be far more corrupt than whatever he is being backmailed for $3.5M

I used to think libertarian viewpoints would consume the republican party. Boy was I wrong. It's the "God party" to the ignorant, "corporate protection party" for the rest of us.

No, but Jackson should still be off the $20. There are so many better options. Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, John Marshall, Sitting Bull, Eisenhower, MLK Jr., Tennessee Williams, etc.

That's a shitty column. He hypothesizes it's due to finance, but the data shows that we see this inequality of distribution across *all sectors*.
Genuine question for any progressives out there. If he held personal beliefs that were in line with the religious right, but held political beliefs that the government shouldn't have a say in those matters. Would you still refuse to vote for him?

Everyone remember the post claiming to out a prominent Republican from awhile back that was never followed up? I wonder if this is what that was about.  I'm on mobile and too lazy to sleuth or post links but gonna throw out the conjecture anyway...
That is one hell of an assumption. I don't see ANY reason for ANY foreign entity to want to buy american products. There is no incentive.
  Like many GOP elected people, they have sold out the public - because they have been bought and paid for.   It is crazy that they Seniors that vote for this guy - are retired because of  public education and Social Security / Medicare- and ignore how the War on Drugs ( one of their own issues) is causing so much pain among the non-WASP.   
Step 1: defund public schools.  Step 2: create privatized education.  Step 3: negotiate mechanisms to transfer public education money to privatized facilities (charters, etc.) further defunding public schools.  Step 4: Act shocked when underfunded schools begin to slip.  Step 5: Claim that it's all about "choice" in education, when it's really just ensuring investments make money, no matter the long-term consequences.

The guy I was replying to said this: &gt;The last 40 years of trade deals may have some responsibility for middle class jobs disappearing from America. They have also been designed to hide that fact from most Americans - the whole point of enabling the cheap import of foreign goods is to hide from the average American worker that he can no longer afford locally produced goods  That doesn't sound like a criticism of specific nuances of certain trade policies but rather a criticism of trade in general, considering the only reason for trade is apparently to secretly hurt the middle class.  EDIT: also, I didn't propose a false dichotomy, I asked a clarifying question.

Most people get their news from Jon Stewart.
This tax plan would be one of the most regressive tax plans of any developed country in the world. Ultimately, what it comes down to, is there is a certain amount of money that must be raised through taxes. Depending on spending, that amount can be scaled up and down, but there is always the question of where it will specifically come from. Santorum's plan would allow for wealthy and high-earning Americans to escape taxation through a variety of different paths. Normal people who work for their income are relatively limited in their tax planning, but the 1%, or even top 10%, whose income is primarily through interest, dividends, capital gains, and inheritance, could virtually completely escape taxation through this plan. Things like the alternative minimum tax exist to try to quash some complicated tax-planning strategies for ultra-wealthy individuals, and Santorum would rip those loopholes back open. The ultimate effect would be that taxes would become something that only those who are so poor that they must work for income would pay. He's purposefully retained all the deductions that most benefit the upper classes and that the ultra-wealthy can use in tax-planning strategies, whereas scrapping tax deductions and credits that benefit the lower and middle classes. The Tax Policy Center came up with an amount the plan would "save" ultra-wealthy taxpayers, but one thing they don't take into consideration, is that these ultra-wealthy taxpayers will change their tax-planning strategies so as to take advantage of Santorum's deliberate tax loopholes so enormous a 1%er can drive a train through them.
It is unbelievable to me that there are some democrats that are actually trying to deprive Americans of jobs as opposed to fighting to create more jobs (not unbelievable to me at all that most Republicans would be for it).
It sure looks like "Coach" Hastert got a little to familiar with some of the boys on the team. A little private instruction it would appear?
If the best defense for this deal is that I don't know what is in it, I don't think I want it.   I don't want to trade my boat for the mystery box, even though that box could have anything in it, even a boat.

What else has doubled in value that fast?  Its the fastest inflating cost in America fueled by federal student loans.  School gets the tuition cash up front.  Students spend next 40 years making payments to the federally backed student loans. Then colleges funnel money back to some of the politicians that made this whole "nationalization" of student loans happen.

I am from Pennsylvania.  We got rid of Rick Santorum and ended up with Pat Toomey.  Pat is not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree; but at least he isn't an embarrassment.
The thing is that we aren't giving a budget to the schools in these proposals, we are giving schools tuition dollars for each student. That incentivizes expanding enrollment and doesn't have a limiting mechanism.
Uhhh...what?! I think your currently dialed in to cynical and you may want to take that down a bit to skeptical.  You have no idea why a foreign entity would want purchase from the US, yet in 2013 U.S. exports were over $2 trillion. That's trillion, with a t. 10% of that was automobiles. While *you* may not understand why foreign entities would buy from America, foreign entities clearly see a reason. $2 trillion in reasons to be specific. I guess its fortunate for the U.S. that global trade doesn't rely on your beliefs.  How can you even begin to talk about trade policy when you don't even accept empirical data on trade. Your cynicism seems eerily close to a religion.

This does not have anything to do with US politics, either:  Did you know that you can easily make smoked eggs in your home smoker? Yes you can and to me, the smoked flavor really sets them off.  I am not one to eat boiled eggs however, with the smoky flavor on these, I will sit down and eat several.  They can also be made into deviled eggs, egg salad etc. and the smoke really compliments the recipe.  The first thing you want to do is to boil the eggs for but don’t get them over done. Try to boil them so that they are just to the point of being done but no more.  At that point, peel the eggs carefully so that you do not mess up the white stuff.   Setup the smoker for cooking at very low temperatures since you only need to smoke the eggs rather than cook them. The lower the better but as high as 200 degrees will also work since you are not leaving them in there very long.  Place the eggs in the smoker for about 30 minutes.  Use pecan, cherry, oak, whatever smoking wood you have available and it will be good.  http://www.smoking-meat.com/smoked-eggs

This is flawed and doesn't nearly capture the entire picture. I worked on Wall Street for 4 years and saw both bonuses and risk-taking substantially DECREASE. Regulations have worked. Balance sheet margin has massively dampened the ability for investment banks to warehouse securities, and hence thinned overall market liquidity.

My bubble of prosperity popped twenty years ago. I made this without any financial help from my family or my friends. Society as a whole can do the same thing.   I know that the poorest have a different world view and I honestly do not care.

The nice ole Clinton dot com bubble.  Clinton was one of the luckiest presidents we ever had.

We have the medical center because Houston is a hub of care for the better part of the Southwest (nevermind that Houston, alone, is the third largest metro area in the nation).  So that may have something to do with the size of our Med Center.  Houston also has something of a nasty problem [with repeat malpractice offenses](http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/dr-evil).  And [it's a recurring story](http://www.texasobserver.org/anatomy-tragedy/).  The Texas Medical Board doesn't have the inclination nor the power to pursue offenders properly, and tort reform has neutered the ability of victims to end the careers of shitty doctors.  Texas also has [the largest uninsurance rate in the nation](http://www.texastribune.org/2014/09/16/texas-tops-census-list-highest-uninsured-rate/) which may explain why our per-capita medical costs are low.  It's not because medical care isn't needed, it's because so many people can't actually afford to receive treatment.  So careful with your facts there.  Texas is not a model for medical care in the rest of the nation.

The leaks last year. It has been widely reported that the TPP allows corporations to sue a government should the government pass laws that negatively impact the corporation's profits. These provisions aren't really new. Uruguay and Australia are both being sued as a result of their laws regarding cigarette packaging. The "courts" are run by corporate lawyers.  I don't see how that does anything but place national sovereignty in the back seat to corporate profits.
Strange that I can easily find all kinds of crazy Republican conspiracies, but you cant find this one you claim was widespread on the left...that Ive never heard of.
68.1% of the US was covered in snow for weeks.  Still positive GDP.  I find it hard to believe that is US history, the only time snow caused a negative GDP was 2014 and 2015.
You're right and have been right for a while. Typically more liberal stances will take hold from generation to generation. Many of the same people who oppose gay marriage have no problem with interracial marriage but their parents would have had a problem with both types of marriage. I'm being very general, there are plenty of people who oppose both who are younger and those older who don't care or support them.   It is one of those things that seems inevitable, it might not happen quickly but after enough of the people hanging on to the old ideas pass then the younger crowd, trending to be more liberal than their parents, will have the majority to pass the laws their parents wouldn't.
While I think you are mistaken as to what the TPP allows corporations to do, I also don't see a fundamental difference between those two.   They both result in governments giving up rights to benefit trade. That's what makes them trade deals.
My assumption is the blackmailer will be brought up on charges, and we'll get the whole story then. Hastert's crimes don't negate the other person's crimes.

&gt; Public outrage can and does kill good laws as much as bad ones. Thats pretty much a wash, imo.  The goal is to have the government represent the will of the people. The fact that public outrage kills "good laws" gets into a whole big philosophical thing about the worth of democracy in general. That is, yes, democracies can make bad choices. That's a given. Show me a political system that never makes bad choices. Non-democratic systems tend to fail even harder.  &gt; Perhaps we'd have to just judge them by their character, their accomplishments, rather than how happy they can keep us.  No, and I'll not talk about jurors and electors and just focus on elected representatives, which is what we've been talking about:  I am voting for a representative to *represent **my** interests* in whatever legislative body or executive or judicial position. The more I know about what they do, the better I can judge how they represent my interests in doing their job. The quality of their character means nothing if they are voting against everything I would be for.  What you basically suggest is that we hide from the public the very thing that the public *elects* these people to do. How is there any accountability at all in that system? We just have to take their word for it that they'll vote for what they *say* they'll vote for?  No, accountability is important. And as I said in the beginning, you're not even attacking the right problem. Lobbyists don't give money directly in return for votes. They give money ahead of time in *hopes* of *influencing* the votes. Listen to the stories of actual Congressman and Senators -- that's what they say, people give them money, and some information, some song and dance, but they don't make a deal like "Vote for this and I'll give you money." What they do is give the money and the info, with the hopes that the representative will remember them later and vote their way. Or they fund representatives that have a record of voting the way they like already.

The religious liberty crowd strikes again.
Andrew Jackson, from Tennessee, was a forceful proponent of Indian removal. In 1814 he commanded the U.S. military forces that defeated a faction of the Creek nation. In their defeat, the Creeks lost 22 million acres of land in southern Georgia and central Alabama. The U.S. acquired more land in 1818 when, spurred in part by the motivation to punish the Seminoles for their practice of harboring fugitive slaves, Jackson's troops invaded Spanish Florida.   From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in negotiating nine out of eleven treaties which divested the southern tribes of their eastern lands in exchange for lands in the west. The tribes agreed to the treaties for strategic reasons. They wanted to appease the government in the hopes of retaining some of their land, and they wanted to protect themselves from white harassment. As a result of the treaties, the United States gained control over three-quarters of Alabama and Florida, as well as parts of Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky and North Carolina. This was a period of voluntary Indian migration, however, and only a small number of Creeks, Cherokee and Choctaws actually moved to the new lands.   In 1823 the Supreme Court handed down a decision which stated that Indians could occupy lands within the United States, but could not hold title to those lands. This was because their "right of occupancy" was subordinate to the United States' "right of discovery." In response to the great threat this posed, the Creeks, Cherokee, and Chicasaw instituted policies of restricting land sales to the government. They wanted to protect what remained of their land before it was too late. Although the five Indian nations had made earlier attempts at resistance, many of their strategies were non-violent.    One method was to adopt Anglo-American practices such as large-scale farming, Western education, and slave-holding. This earned the nations the designation of the "Five Civilized Tribes." They adopted this policy of assimilation in an attempt to coexist with settlers and ward off hostility. But it only made whites jealous and resentful. Other attempts involved ceding portions of their land to the United States with a view to retaining control over at least part of their territory, or of the new territory they received in exchange. Some Indian nations simply refused to leave their land -- the Creeks and the Seminoles even waged war to protect their territory.   The First Seminole War lasted from 1817 to 1818. The Seminoles were aided by fugitive slaves who had found protection among them and had been living with them for years. The presence of the fugitives enraged white planters and fueled their desire to defeat the Seminoles. The Cherokee used legal means in their attempt to safeguard their rights. They sought protection from land-hungry white settlers, who continually harassed them by stealing their livestock, burning their towns, and sqatting on their land.   In 1827 the Cherokee adopted a written constitution declaring themselves to be a sovereign nation. They based this on United States policy; in former treaties, Indian nations had been declared sovereign so they would be legally capable of ceding their lands. Now the Cherokee hoped to use this status to their advantage. The state of Georgia, however, did not recognize their sovereign status, but saw them as tenants living on state land. The Cherokee took their case to the Supreme Court, which ruled against them.   The Cherokee went to the Supreme Court again in 1831. This time they based their appeal on an 1830 Georgia law which prohibited whites from living on Indian territory after March 31, 1831, without a license from the state. The state legislature had written this law to justify removing white missionaries who were helping the Indians resist removal. The court this time decided in favor of the Cherokee. It stated that the Cherokee had the right to self-government, and declared Georgia's extension of state law over them to be unconstitutional. The state of Georgia refused to abide by the Court decision, however, and President Jackson refused to enforce the law.   In 1830, just a year after taking office, Jackson pushed a new piece of legislation called the "Indian Removal Act" through both houses of Congress. It gave the president power to negotiate removal treaties with Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi. Under these treaties, the Indians were to give up their lands east of the Mississippi in exchange for lands to the west. Those wishing to remain in the east would become citizens of their home state. This act affected not only the southeastern nations, but many others further north. The removal was supposed to be voluntary and peaceful, and it was that way for the tribes that agreed to the conditions. But the southeastern nations resisted, and Jackson forced them to leave.   Jackson's attitude toward Native Americans was paternalistic and patronizing -- he described them as children in need of guidance. and believed the removal policy was beneficial to the Indians. Most white Americans thought that the United States would never extend beyond the Mississippi. Removal would save Indian people from the depredations of whites, and would resettle them in an area where they could govern themselves in peace. But some Americans saw this as an excuse for a brutal and inhumane course of action, and protested loudly against removal. Their protests did not save the southeastern nations from removal, however.   The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty, which they did in September of 1830. Some chose to stay in Mississippi under the terms of the Removal Act.. But though the War Department made some attempts to protect those who stayed, it was no match for the land-hungry whites who squatted on Choctaw territory or cheated them out of their holdings. Soon most of the remaining Choctaws, weary of mistreatment, sold their land and moved west.   For the next 28 years, the United States government struggled to force relocation of the southeastern nations. A small group of Seminoles was coerced into signing a removal treaty in 1833, but the majority of the tribe declared the treaty illegitimate and refused to leave. The resulting struggle was the Second Seminole War, which lasted from 1835 to 1842. As in the first war, fugitive slaves fought beside the Seminoles who had taken them in. Thousands of lives were lost in the war, which cost the Jackson administration approximately 40 to 60 million dollars -- ten times the amount it had allotted for Indian removal.   In the end, most of the Seminoles moved to the new territory. The few who remained had to defend themselves in the Third Seminole War (1855-58), when the U.S. military attempted to drive them out. Finally, the United States paid the remaining Seminoles to move west. The Creeks also refused to emigrate. They signed a treaty in March, 1832, which opened a large portion of their Alabama land to white settlement, but guaranteed them protected ownership of the remaining portion, which was divided among the leading families. The government did not protect them from speculators, however, who quickly cheated them out of their lands.   By 1835 the destitute Creeks began stealing livestock and crops from white settlers. Some eventually committed arson and murder in retaliation for their brutal treatment. In 1836 the Secretary of War ordered the removal of the Creeks as a military necessity. By 1837, approximately 15,000 Creeks had migrated west. They had never signed a removal treaty. The Chickasaws had seen removal as inevitable, and had not resisted. They signed a treaty in 1832 which stated that the federal government would provide them with suitable western land and would protect them until they moved. But once again, the onslaught of white settlers proved too much for the War Department, and it backed down on its promise.   The Chickasaws were forced to pay the Choctaws for the right to live on part of their western allotment. They migrated there in the winter of 1837-38. The Cherokee, on the other hand, were tricked with an illegitimate treaty. In 1833, a small faction agreed to sign a removal agreement: the Treaty of New Echota. The leaders of this group were not the recognized leaders of the Cherokee nation, and over 15,000 Cherokees -- led by Chief John Ross -- signed a petition in protest.   The Supreme Court ignored their demands and ratified the treaty in 1836. The Cherokee were given two years to migrate voluntarily, at the end of which time they would be forcibly removed. By 1838 only 2,000 had migrated; 16,000 remained on their land. The U.S. government sent in 7,000 troops, who forced the Cherokees into stockades at bayonet point.   They were not allowed time to gather their belongings, and as they left, whites looted their homes. Then began the march known as the Trail of Tears, in which 4,000 Cherokee people died of cold, hunger, and disease on their way to the western lands. By 1837, the Jackson administration had removed 46,000 Native American people from their land east of the Mississippi, and had secured treaties which led to the removal of a slightly larger number. Most members of the five southeastern nations had been relocated west, opening 25 million acres of land to white settlement and to slavery.

Very true. I'm starting to believe that the type of lefties you'll find on r/politics are the left wing equivalent of the tea party. Just no-knowledge people that have 0 grasp of anything finance/economics/business related, and who are all too easily swayed by BS ideological ramblings.

&gt; If you can buy more stuff, real wages aren't down. That's the definition of a real wage.  Nope. Real wages are not defined by the amount of goods you can purchase. Please do not post incorrect information.

&gt; Texas is not a model for medical care in the rest of the nation.  Careful with that kind of talk, they may take your big hat away from you.
You don't benefit from an educated populace and getting money out of politics?
Why did other states do the same? Why are some states that accepted the expansion now asking the federal government for more money?  The way I understood it, if you accept the expansion, you get millions for the next few years, but then the government money (EDIT) decreases.     In the past, more money is always voted for by Congress, continuing the short "boost" into perpetuity, greatly increasing the costs of such a program that was only supposed to last for a few years, and was sold to the American people as costing as much.     Everyone is for more money going to the poor. What government program expansion has shown to keep more and more money coming? Shouldn't we be focusing on streamlining the best programs that really help people, rather than dumping money into medicare and medicaid, that often just exacerbate the problem of medical costs for everyone and result in sub-par care? 
Or perhaps, if you break the law in egregious ways (like unnecesarily beating/killing a civilian) when you are supposed to be a paragon-of-law, then you are dishonorably discharged and don't get ANY retirement funds.

&gt; Parents choosing better education for their children is not based on long-term consequences? Really?  Yes, absolutely. Welcome to reality.  The pitch (and I've heard it from my financial advisors a dozen times) is that when private schools have access to public money, they almost guarantee a massive profit. That this then asks public schools to do more for less is no accident, it's the intended result. It's basic business: cripple your competition. Your mistake is that you think it's about education, when it's just about profit. It's short-term profit at the expense of the widespread population's access to education.  Realistically, [charters perform no better than public schools](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/charters-not-outperforming-nations-traditional-public-schools-report-says/2013/06/24/23f19bb8-dd0c-11e2-bd83-e99e43c336ed_story.html), but they do so while making some people (me, if I'd accepted any of the offers, and friends of mine who did) a shitload of money at the expense of the performance of the overall education system.  Which brings us to:  &gt; Parents will keep the money that was stolen from them to pay for shitty public education, and instead use it to pay for private education that offers better education for their children.  This is the epitome of the "fuck the rest, I got mine" attitude that will crater the country if it spreads. Individual members of society have an obligation to the whole, and the whole is stronger for it. Money isn't "stolen" to pay for public education, it's used to strengthen the same. We are all better with an educated populace. That the children of those with means have more opportunity isn't new, but that you want to enable a further tilt of that landscape by taking from those with less is fucking shameful.
Tell that to Texas.
Nearly all economists agree that NAFTA has been to everyone's benefit.  The middle-class didn't suffer for it, quite the opposite.  Not sure why Bernie seems to feel trade deals are inherently bad for Americans.  Or maybe he's just pandering what he knows his base wants to hear.  
He explicitly said "*some* responsibility". Short of going into detail regarding *which* policies, his statement, by itself, was valid.
&gt;  **and services**  Thank you.  
It might swing back the other way, but nowhere close to where the GOP is now.  If we look at the history of this country, it always swings more to the left than it does to the right.
Oh happy Friday!! Bernie opened his bloviating pie hole again. And life is good. Redditors on /r/politics now have something to jerk off about over the weekend. You know that nobody gives a shit what he says right? This is a political sub. Are you all morons with no sense of understanding of politics? He is a fringe character. Like George Wallace, Lyndon LaRouche and Pat Paulson. For the love of god can someone post anything in this sub that isn't something Bernie Sanders farts out every fifteen minutes? 
&gt; What else has doubled in value that fast?  The American stock market.  The Chinese stock market.  Everyone's 401k.  Gold.  Art.  The price of a gallon of gas.  Any number of companies.  What your real problem is that you like the system when it allows billionaires who look forward to returning to 1880 to influence the system but not schools who are looking forward to 2030.
&gt; The result is an order of magnitude less gunshots and complaints and more crimes solved as they're each a mini detective.  How many murders per year in Germany again?
I in fact only have one of those things good sir!
Actually instead of expanding medicaid, Texas launched an alternative called DSRIP which funds programs to help unfunded and underfunded populations and increase quality of care.  I wrote the proposal at the hospital I worked at, at the time.  Though i no longer work in the space...Each county has a seat which approves and monitors progress and controls the release of funds after the project is approved by the state.  A good portion of these project focus around keeping people out of hospitals...  Woefully ignorant to ignore such a thing... 
I feel the same way.  That said, thus far in the 2016 field, that applies less to him and more to everyone else. 
Is anyone else old enough to remember this kind of fear-mongering around NAFTA? We somehow survived that one, and Mexico became a partner instead of an adversary. Ask the people of Cuba how they feel about markets being opened to them.

&gt; then that guy works on something else  While I think you are mostly right, I also think the average guy working in a cube just does what his boss tells him.  "Hey boss, I read some news stories about aspects of our collection program not being legal - you're sure this part is fine though?"  "Yup, this section of analysis has been cleared by our lawyers."  "Cool."  If someone a few levels up at the government wants the program to happen they'll just change a few things around and it'll happen.
You're exactly correct. Don't even venture into /r/Futurology or /r/BasicIncome.  Modded by non-experts making cringe-worthy claims about the economy and people eat it up.

We also consider ourselves the "Nuclear Watchdog" even though we're the only country to have used an atomic in an act of war... go figure.  Add to that the title of main "Drug Warrior" even though we lead the world in illegal drug use (or at least we did in 2008).
Make police officers carry liability insurance.  The worst offenders will quickly be priced out of their profession.  I'm a contract trainer, and I have to carry $1m in liability insurance. Costs about $400 a year.

I basically had an intellectual mentor through my four years of college (several, actually) and access to people who could have conversations with me. Learning via reading doesn't work for everyone and is also significantly different from learning via discussion.  Then you have the number of people who aren't motivated enough to learn 100% on their own (if they were, this country would be full of self-successful entrepreneurs), but *are* motivated enough to learn with tutelage.

Well I mean, you can look at this as a pure business decision.  Currently the market for oil (and even more specifically oil-shales) is at essentially an all time low. This is the perfect time for a business to re look at their model and make sure they are going about things the best and most efficient way possible (which research into environmental effects will help clarify).. Then when the market for your product comes back, you are ready to be an even more profitable and efficient business.  Along with that, simply by doing nothing the guy has made a brilliant political move by basically doing nothing to hinder the long term output of oil yet having people think it's for environmental reasons.   I'm not American myself so I can't speak to whole Republican vs Democrat thing.

Since you have such a strong opinion on this tax. Maybe you can tell all of us why this would be so dumb? I've traded for several years and the stock market is corrupt as fuck. The biggest corruption I can think of is these slimy, massive mutual funds who commit HFT(high frequency trading). It is a bane to the stock market and shouldn't be allowed to happen. It devalues stocks that I trade because it's reckless and meaningless. That shit would be cut out real quick if this tax was passed. 
&gt; more jobs  Where you getting that from?
The problem in america today is that the electorate is too fucking retarded too call politicians out on these "double speak" fashion of naming bills.  Example: Patriot Act, or Womens Freedom acts (which are actually anti-abortion rules).    The country has become proud of how fucking stupid it has become.   We idolize ignorant sister fucking characters like the duck dynasty guys.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to predict where that type of behavior gets you.
You took the very words out of my fucking mouth. 
If you weren't talking out of your ass, you'd probably say what was said and what came true. You didn't.
Great point.  I've actually learned some things today.  Thanks.
So if I understand this, and correct me if I am wrong, those are good for increasing trade surplus and imports into the US. I don't see in your examples where it has created or kept "more jobs". All of this seems it would be at the cost of american jobs, no?

You cannot point to NAFTA and say it is the same as every other trade deal.  The mobility of labor to following work (both legally and illegally) on the continent makes it far more like the European trade areas than the TPP.
&gt;Some things, like housing, can't be imported. Cheap consumer goods don't translate to increased buying power across the board.  This isn't true. We import plenty of building supplies and even labor. Cheap consumer goods **does** translate to increased buying power by definition. 
In a future where jobs are much more scarce and some kind of basic income is necessary population control will be an important part of policy
It in Leviticus. Somewhere in the back. 
So if company B invests $1 billion dollars in infrastructure in country X and then the government of country X decides its going to nationalise company B's industry, you'd be fine telling company B "tough luck bro."   Or if country X decides it changed its mind after the $1 billion investment and it was going to raise tarrifs on company B's industry...tough luck.  Companies need to have some measure of assurance that their investment won't be rendered worthless, or else the risk will outweigh the benefits. Therefore an adjudicative process of some sort is needed to try and solve these issues and issues arising between transactions occurring among companies in different countries. What is the best manner in which an adjudicative institution should be arranged? Great question, and one that can certainly be debated. But the existence of a neutral adjudicative institution is essential to any trade agreement...or for that matter any agreement...between entities.

All those saying it can't be done aren't realizing the power of the internet and crowd sourcing. We need complex programs to better organize and present data between groups and it should be efficient enough.
Nope.  You would see what you have not yet imagined.  Nobody would want to be cops anymore.  Either that, or police would demand outrageous amounts of money to be glorified bullet stoppers.
According to google, a majority of police departments in the US require a highschool diploma and 9 to 14 weeks of police academy.  It does however state that more departments are moving to 2 year degree requirements which is awesome.

&gt; Generally, services can't be exported, so you have very little of an argument here.  On the contrary. That is vital to my argument. It is entirely consistent to have both lower cost of *goods* (stuff) as well as declining *real wages*. That much is clear from the actual definition of *real wages* (unlike the incorrect definition that EconMan appealed to).  &gt; And this very small point you may have that only applies to very specific industries still doesn't change the fact that you were wrong prior and needed to be corrected.  I did not make an incorrect statement. The statement "Real wages are not defined by the amount of goods you can purchase." is wholly accurate.

&gt; facts  Yes, let's talk about "facts," shall we?  None of us here in this thread are in possession of **all** of them, so long as portions of the 9/11 report and the NIST report on WTC-7 remain classified.   So don't even pretend like you have some sort of high ground, because you don't. We're all on a level playing field as long as there are official secrets. 
&gt; That is not how any of them are funded elsewhere by my understanding.  Other countries don't have entire economies that are driven almost completely by their stock market though. 
Well, it used to be that police went through some schooling.  Back in the 80s things started changing as there was a sudden need for more police. The 90s it got worse as cops were retiring in droves.  So they shortened the whole thing to a few months and now we have quick trigger cops with any excuse to stop a car or go into a house, because they can be ignorant of the law, but you cannot.  o.O

Did you read it?  What sticks out as misogynistic to you?  I understood it as criticizing misogyny.
Conservatives are such assholes.
The training and education of the population, in general, affects the rate of murder and rape.  Better police training results in less gunshots results in less manslaughter. Better training prison staff results in less inmate rapes.  But that aside. The more education, IN GENERAL and easier access to education IN GENERAL absolutely affects the rates of murders and rapes.  In Germany, you can now to go to college for free. It breaks my heart that we have so many people wanting to become educated, and they literally can't here.  I'm glad online free learning tools are online, it's a shame very few hold any useful accreditation
Alternatively, see Japan's current demographic time bomb. Europe is not far behind. The U.S. would be screwed too except we have a lot of fecund immigrants streaming in.
&gt;Some conservatives criticized the bill for “pork spending” and not including spending cuts to offset expenditures  seeing as sandy relief money was being used to fund tv commercials urging people to vacation to nj over a year after the fact, this seems like a pretty legitimate complaint.  the devil is in the details, and people should actually figure out what a bill does before supporting/opposing it.

 &gt;Yes, if it means not ceding sovereignty - maybe that country has a good reason. It's a small risk for companies behaving responsibly. What percentage of corporations has this happened to? What percentage of law abiding corporations has this happened to?  This does happen very frequently in countries without developed legal systems. In the US, the 5th amendment guarantees compensation for taking property already, so this isn't any change from our current practices. It just provides a separate avenue to do so in countries without existing protections.  &gt;What are the assurances of neutrality? Any steps taken at all?  There are extensive practices in place to prevent conflicts of interest. Just look at how often a company's own arbitrator rules against them if you're concerned.   &gt;What protections does the country have from frivolous lawsuits? One's designed to settle because the resources needed to fight it in a 'neutral' court outweigh the risk? Currently, none - do you see that being added in?  The TPP is actually taking steps to ensure that losers pay, designed to cut down on abuses of ISDS by tobacco companies. But its not as if the existing system isn't working.   &gt;Aren't we just shifting the risk to the states?  ISDS is an arbitration system designed to fill a hole in international law. There isnt any international supreme court, or some international Bill of Rights that all countries must abide by. For foreign companies that have their rights violated, they have no recourse unless a trade treaty specifically provides one.   The US doesn't lose ISDS cases partly because we already have a fair legal system. Not every country does. There's really nothing allowed in ISDS that isn't already allowed in the US legal system.

I find this ridiculous.  If we really were the biggest source of terrorism, then why do countries like Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, the entire EU, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Taiwan look to us for security?  Why would all of the tribes in Afghanistan want us to stay in their country?  Why is Iraq wanting us to come back?  Terrorist groups don't often get invited back or asked to stay in places that they supposedly terrorized.
The Founders all had skeletons in their closet and were guilty of these "crimes" anyway. Yet Reason is one of the passionate defenders of original intent on things like the 2nd Amendment. Even though the original intent was a bunch of white racist oppressive slave owners. So... what a poor argument Reason.
No
52% of the country is pro-maybe.
Self-sufficiency is important if global networks break down. For example if we have another world War or such having no manufacturing locally will really screw us.   Also it is just better for us to be self sufficient. Look at Germany. The manufacture a shit ton of stuff however it is really only high end stuff. Let Asia make the cheap shit and Germans can make luxury versions etc.   Germany exports more than we do. No joke. 
Aggressive in there right to exist in more and more places...
Yes, nothing. They don't give two shits about what happens to the child once it is born. It isn't about life, it's just about being born and that's it. Pro-life would imply that there is concern about the kind of life a child is going to have and how it will be raised.
*slurp slurp* gotta get that campaign cash any way you can *slurp slurp*
the governments are voluntarily agreeing to put foreign companies on equal footing with their own domestic companies going forward, and agreeing to accept a penalty in the event a neutral arbitration panel concludes that the government has broken that agreement.  the countries are agreeing to this because the countries' citizens almost always benefit from the investments made by foreign companies.  if each government agreeing to limit its power to affect the competitiveness of foreign companies results in more investment by foreign companies, then almost everyone comes out ahead.  it is hardly ever a good thing if a new government policy treats foreign companies unfairly compared to domestic companies.  that discourages foreign companies from investing in and providing jobs in the country.
So barf up half a dozen posts claiming the data and evidence is on your side, but then cannot cite a *single* source.  How old are you?  I'm guessing a sophomore or junior in college.  Am I right?

Most countries "friendly" with America know what happens to countries who try to go against them. It also helps when their lunatic oligarchy vision along with our lunatic oligarchy.  Why do Afghan tribes want them back? Because they get weapons from America and America will help them kill the tribes they hate. No one wants America around. They just want their weapons. I am willing to bet the majority just doesn't want any foreign invaders.

&gt; having a million dollars saved up is pretty much the minimum amount of money you need to be able to stop focusing on living paycheck-to-paycheck  As a member of /r/financialindependence and regular reader of [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/), I scoff at thee.  It's quite possible to retire at $750k and never work another day you don't want to, and further, that it's possible to achieve that in a reasonable timeframe on a five-digit salary thanks to compounding.
It is very frustrating when the authors put so much effort into pulling all these statistics together but fail to include the total cost of police operations for each city so that an intelligent comparison of the costs can be made.  
i'm pro-choice up to about 12 weeks
&gt; Am I pro-life? Serious question.  Irrelevant.  This is standard conservative argument framing 101. First they stake out a position nobody can really argue against: that late term abortions are bad. Nobody really disagrees with this, and if you look at the numbers, the overwhelming majority of abortions aren't even in late term. Those that are, are for cases where its' gonna kill the mother, nonviable/otherwise fucked-up fetus, etc.   Now the conservatives have the goal post. Now they move it inward - witness the 15/20 week abortion bans popping up in conservative ruled (not governed, they don't do that) states.  Its' like when a pro-birther says they are concerned about the health of women when pushing for TRAP laws that shut down abortion clinics in a state. Its' a fucking lie, and everyone knows its' a fucking lie, but its' just plausible enough to maybe get past a judge.  The mistake you are making is that conservatives are working in good faith. They aren't. 
The other problem is the Police Officers Bill of Rights.   In Baltimore, this has been so perverted that the folks in charge have little means to hold officers accountable.

See, your latest comment is exactly what is wrong with the delusion you're the victim of -- you literally believe that the only two options to effect meaningful change are to (a) valiantly pray to a cardboard box (b) cowardly refuse to pray to the cardboard box.  This manichean black-or-white view of yours, part of your political schizophrenia, is not just defective and wrong, but also dumb, corrupt, and deceives people into not doing anything that is *actually* effective... after all, if someone else believes that those truly are the two options (they are not, but let's assume someone believes your nonsense), then they will be locked into not doing anything effective, ever, at all.  So, insofar as you tacitly suggest that people like me "do nothing about it",  who the fuck told you that "I do nothing about it"?  No one, really.  You don't know me, so you don't know what I do or do not do in order to effect meaningful change on the world.  *You literally just hallucinated that smear out of thin air.*  Can you get more delusional than that?
/u/funky_duck I'm sorry to hear the situation you would be in.  But as you know the militarization of police has caused a huge uptick in police violence.  I'm sorry if that would adversely effect your pension, but if that slows down or stops police on civilian shootings, then so be it.  The stats don't lie, and you are by far more likely to die from a police officer than a terrorist.  I will not keep sacrificing my rights so police feel more safe, you are not obligated to be cops, you can leave anytime if you are not feeling safe or fear for your life.  Do not expect the public to keep sacrificing our rights so police are more safe.  And with that being said, police need to do more to ensure they keep US safe, starting with reducing police brutality.  Body cameras and actual punishment that hits the police in their pockets are the only things that will work. Because as you know, the justice system is oh so good at prosecuting police brutality (cough heavy sarcasm)

We armed the mujaheddin to fight the Soviets, the same way they helped armed the NLF and the NVA to fight us in Vietnam.  One of the big reasons that places like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were able to come into power was because we walked away after the Soviets left.  It was almost the exact same kind of situation.  There's a big difference between a country doing some shady shit which was wrong, and being a terrorist organization.

Neoliberalism - for example, Obama and his democracy killing trade deals..  Obama's alliance with Republicans shows that Neoliberalism/Neoconservativism are both pretty similar.  :(
No. When you get blackmailed, you go to the police or the FBI. Since he apparently couldn't do that for whatever reason, he entered into a series of very shady transactions to hide the source and destination of these funds and in doing so committed several crimes.
&gt; Yeah, that's why the line "Don't like abortions? Don't get one" doesn't make a lot of sense to pro-lifers. If a fetus is a person, then no matter how you justify it, abortion is still killing a person.   Then the pro-birthers (they are not "pro-life") then show their hand when they are fine with the death penalty, and rally against birth control. 
there is no reason for the federal government to be footing the bill on that. that is the state of new jersey's responsibility.  repair damaged structures and make sure people have food and water, but the federal government doesn't need to fund repairing damaged reputations. it's pork, plain and simple.
Cars, technology, medicine, research, widgets, fleshlights. 
&gt; What? Since when are pro-lifers saying it should be OK to murder innocent already born humans?  Every time the state executes a person.
This is actually extremely relevant considering H Clinton refuses to side either way on the trade deal and Bernie is getting out in front of it.  But in general, I agree he is a bit circle jerked. I suppose this is what grass roots enthusiasm looks like?

&gt; a book that claims the Earth is flat.  And again, if you read the rebutals you'll note that the Bible makes no such claim unless you read both literally and carry the translation to the most extreme and literal context.  Without a doubt the bible makes certain literal claims - God created the earth, Christ rose from the dead.  But looking at those sentences and stating that the bible is literally claiming the earth is flat (which, btw, requires also ignoring the sections where it literally claims the earth is round that are also noted on that same page) is a stretch. Or rather it's a cheap move.
&gt;~~serial abuser of executive power.~~*genocidal*  Let's not mince words. . .
Thats the single, largest problem to the pro-life argument. When abortion is taken out of the picture there aren't many choices and most definitely not any choices that will benefit the child. The pro-life position needs to not only concern itself about the life of the unborn child, but also the life of that same child after birth.
I just lol'd in my pants
How does it feel spending so much time and effort and money supporting BS and yet knowing he will NEVER be elected P?  
Definitely not from Chicago.  50 miles west.  Out in farm country.
Or they accurately acted as their constituents wanted.  You seem to think they mind paying more.  They don't. It's about not giving prove things deemed not deserved.  Not to mention the private hospitals just write off unfunded as charity care, which is required to maintain non profit status, among with some other things.
Dude half the country has found your mom.

I hate these stupid terms. No one is pro-death. We are all pro-life. Some women for whatever reason must make the difficult choice to terminate pregnancies. A few women might see abortions as just anothe family planning method, but they are not pro-death, they are just irresponsible twits with who put a low value on their making of lives. Responsible men and women don't need to resort to abortions but sometimes the situation occurs even to responsible people.

bingo. It is the equivalent of fox news. I come for the laughs and to smh, - very rarely dissapointed.
I think they usually have the requirement that the person should be guilty of a pretty heinous crime, not innocent.
You seem to be thinking I am in favor of police violence or something.  Police need to be held accountable but taking pension money is a terrible way to do it for the reasons I stated and you haven't refuted.  I am in favor of cameras and I am very much in favor of DAs actually punishing police.  I am also in favor of requiring individual liability insurance much like doctors have.
Power lies where people choose to see it... A lot of people practically consider Bernie their president.     
[Consensus by economists is that NAFTA has been a net benefit to Americans](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/nafta-20-years-later-benefits-outweigh-costs/).  
I too think that he should be *allowed* to run for office, but in fairness in any other field he'd be fucked.  The truly puzzling thing for us isn't that he was allowed to run, but that Texans felt that a past felon was a better candidate than anyone else. Forgive,  don't forget.
It's interesting that people are upset Texas didn't accept the medicaid expansion, when by not doing so, Texas takes less money from the federal government while still supplying medical care to their uninsured. Texas still cares for their uninsured, but instead of tax payers in New York helping cover their costs, Texas pays for their own uninsured.   People are literally complaining that Texas is taking care of itself instead of using other people's money. 
Have to do away with qualified immunity first. 
While we're at it let's do a few other things:  1) Make it more colorful, like Canada's money.  2) Make it out of a more durable material, like Canada's money.  3) Put more cool stuff on it. Canada has the ISS's CanadaArm and hockey players and trains on their money.  4) Make them different sizes to be recognizable for the blind.  Basically just take all the best parts of EU and Canadian money. Slap the presidents on there, change out Jackson and put Tubman if you want, boom.

Try investing in education rather than cutting funding for it. 
Seems like r/politics is filled with sensationalists.  The sandy bill was over 60% extraneous funding(pork). 
If tobacco companies suing foreign nations over anti-smoking campaigns is "trade" then just about any law is a trade law. When people hear "trade agreement" they think of things like tariffs. 
Is that your sources? A poll? Nice.
Seems pretty good to me. 
My recolection was wrong, but I stress my point. It sounds like a great deal and there will be savings, but over time Medicaid spending will accelerate in each state and dwarf any projected uncompensated care savings and federal government money. This happened in Maine, where they thought expanding medicaid would decrease the number of uninsured and those on uncompensated care (same thinking as this expansion). But Maine found the opposite to be true with uncompensated care increasing and the number of uninsured staying the same. http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/Committees/2012-2014/SPPA/MeetingRecords/MeetingPacket_2026.pdf
Quality goods cost more to produce and don't need to be re-purchased as often.  It's difficult to compete with a product your customers will never have to buy again.  Even a gum commercial had satire commercials about how sales were terrible because their gum flavor lasted too long.  They were (jokingly) begging people to spit out their gum more often and chew new pieces or else they would go out of business.  Found one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdTZwQwI6lo&amp;list=RDNdTZwQwI6lo#t=28

Stop treating the poor then. Loss of billions is NOTHING compared to what they are going to lose from the consequences of disrupting the natural selection. Very short sighted. Darwinism proved by concrete science is the only true progression.

I remember drinking Thums Up and Campa-cola on a trip to India in the 90s. They were actually quite good compared to Americans brands. It's actually sad that foreigners managed to buy out local competition and shut out the competitors that didn't capitulate. If anything it furthers the argument that trade deals are a bad idea.

Well, if Progressive Billionaire Nick Hanauer says it, it must be true.
idiots do not realize that many states are required by law to balance their budgets. Thanks to Obamacare, the states had a huge financial burden thrust onto them because the federal funds used for Medicaid were taken away to use on Obamacare. Many states cannot afford this. It's simple economics people. This shit isn't free, taxpayers have to pay for all this bullshit one way or another.   Please, downvote if you are too stupid to understand this.
Or unsafe working conditions.
This is beyond stupid. Just like the Sacagawea coin. Look at all the inequality it solved.   Can we please focus on things that will actually make a true change for equality. Not just blatant pandering.   This is a straw man and we all fell for it. Including me.
Or you have some sort of coalition between some countries that agrees to abide by certain rules regarding certain things because, although in principle each could country decide for itself, having consistent rules and policies helps everyone stop a race to the bottom and makes life better for everyone. Like the appropriate rate for import tariffs, fair labor practices, or how to deal with IP. This might be called a trade partnership, and each country could agree to the terms and leave the partnership if they wanted (at which point the other countries wouldn't have to honor their terms with that country).  Notice that this doesn't require a single world government or handing monopoly privileges to a corporate entity. It's a trade negotiation - you honor our patents instead of letting local corps rip off our nation's products, we don't tax import/export to your country etc. Of course a country is free to stick to its principles on patents, but then it won't get anything in return.
This is such a great time to be living. I'm hopeful that eventually there'll be enough pressure to actually push through truly progressive legistlation

All that you criticize as lacking in the pro-life movement is what Catholic Charities does. This is just one example of pro-life people acting in a pro-life manner, that is caring about the baby born and the lives of the less fortunate everywhere. Not everyone wants a government solution to these societal problems, but that hardly means they don't want the same thing you do with respect to health and opportunity.
The Supreme Court [recently ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heien_v._North_Carolina) that traffic stops are legal when an officer has "reasonable suspicion" that a law has been broken, even if no such law actually exists. Traffic cops, at least, no longer even have to know the laws that they're enforcing.
Too bad we don't do that.
Are you unaware that the survey is essentially a measure of the credulity of the audience?  FOX has the most bamboozled group of viewers... congrats?

I'd like to say I'm shocked...but.
Services are far less preferable than manufacturing.  Service sector jobs are less dependable, generally lower wage and much less likely to be unionized.  
It's the only place he's safe from the black helicopters.
Are we reading the same article? I got:  29% All  13% Most  -------  42%... Where did your 60% come from?   The way I see it,  the majority would like abortion  to be **illegal** in most circumstances (19+36=55%).  Sure the "few"  people may identify as pro-choice, but they're not for abortion on demand for any reason.
Well I think there's a big difference between letting it lapse and having the government actually pass laws banning those things. My first thought on this was also that they'll never stop unless maybe they actively dismantled it. 
That's what baffles me. They know what they're doing by intentionally promoting it like that. Now, if you care for the life of a growing child, you're on the side of evil.   "Anti-choice" is somehow more evil than "Anti-life". People have this weird notion of Conservative being evil and Libral being good, but realistically good lies somewhere in the middle.   At least that's what i think. Neither side is inherently good or bad. Now the leaders... that's another story.  
Why would the victim wait? And how do we know it's a victim, and not just a students mother he had an affair with, knocked her up, and now he pay back child support, cost of school, lost time, and what not?
Efficiency only matters to economists and the people who hold the bank accounts that the gains from said efficiencies go to.  What actually matters is how to get the most money into the pockets of the middle class so they can spend it.  That means more jobs at all skill levels with higher wages.
Yes okay, the title is a bit dumb but the sentiment is real. 
Look at the poll. You can get a history lesson just looking at it. American puppets love America. The more a nation has been devastated or manipulated by America, the lower.  You know why Israeli is at 97%? Because America is gleefully funding their genocide.
Even if Sander's argument is absolutely true it's clearly outweighed by the benefits of the rise of a global middle class. More people have escaped poverty in the developing world in the last decade than in America during the entire 20th century. Can anyone explain why all the disadvantages to this deal outweigh the immense benefits of adding an excess of one trillion dollars to global gross product? I'm a progressive but this comparison is where nationalists and trade unionists lose me.

You're right, however the better answer is to care for more babies after birth, not kill more before birth.
What does this mean?
You can say you're in favor of cameras, but that's pretty simplistic.  There's far more that goes in to what a camera program looks like and how you fund it.  Storage in particular is an expensive problem.  How will video be stored?  How long will it be retained?  When is video public record?  Who can get the video?  Under what circumstances?  When do cops get to turn the cameras off?  When do they have to turn them off?  Where is the camera mounted?  Cameras on cops' chests are a great idea until you realize that most cops cant their bodies to the side when aiming a firearm.  Nothing relevant will be captured.  In theory, cameras are great, but the details are a problem.
Except the loss of manufacturing jobs has led to an increase in the unemployed, and slowed wage growth in all but the most specialized career fields.  Combined with rising rent/energy costs those non-manufacturing sector workers aren't gaining anything from cheaper disposable crap.
Yes, but that .1% is 12% of our country's GDP.  In 2008 our manufacturing produced more money than both china and india's manufacturing put together. We produce 21% of the worlds manufacturing output but in the past 15 years we have lost 1 in 6 manufacturing jobs.   
Ok. I overlooked that. My bad.  I still don't like it.

Exactly. If anything this will just be spun to support UK style censorship. The problem with things like this and OWS is that we don't have mature people handling these protests. We have man-children who think protesting congress and trolling someone online as if they're a YouTube commenter are the same thing.

&gt; Self-sufficiency is important if global networks break down. For example if we have another world War  You're not kidding, if we hadn't happened to have the assembly lines available from all the factories going to mass production pre WWII we would have had a very hard time contributing to the war effort.  Manufacturing needs serious re-investment in this country and we need our damned unions back.

&gt;We execute folks who are provably, or are at least possibly, innocent every now and again. Where's the right wing pro-life outrage?!  If a pro-life person believed the prisoner was innocent, I'm sure they'd be outraged. It's rarely so cut and dry, and pro-death penalty pro-lifers may simply be more likely to believe the state can be trusted to get the right outcome. When it comes to fetuses, it's a lot more cut and dry.  &gt;The police kill thousands of citizens who aren't convicted of any crime every year, where's the outrage by the pro-life crowd?   They probably usually believe if you get killed by the cops, you're guilty of something, and could have complied harder or something. It's not quite like a fetus, where it's pretty obvious it hasn't done anything.  &gt;Where's the outrage when a pro-lifer shoots a doctor who does abortions?   The doctor isn't an innocent person, in their opinion.  &gt;Why are pro-lifers fighting access to comprehensive sex education and birth control?  They think sexual promiscuity is a bad thing and don't want to encourage it.  &gt;Why are pro-lifers waging court battles over birth control?  They don't want to be forced to pay for something they think promotes immoral behavior.  &gt;These people are pro something, but it isn't life.  Do I need to point out that pro-choicers aren't really pro-choice? They're against my right to choose to work for less than minimum wage, they're against my right to choose to cut hair without a license, they're against my right to choose to own a gun, and so on and so forth. Pro-life is a term that everyone understands to mean the person thinks abortion should be illegal. Pro-choice is a term everyone understands to mean the person thinks abortion should be legal.
Make the top one percent wealthiest Americans buy all the goods and services for everyone else, probably.

Bill clinton, elected by the people for the people pushed for it in the house. Calling people who are opposed that something in the line of hating the poor.
you were in favor of police violence the moment you signed up to be one, even if the violence was justified or unjustified depending on the situation, you still operated on the notion that police have a direct monopoly on violence.
It's amazing to me that someone just standing up and telling the truth is considered such a visionary or special. And hated by so many normal Americans who believe the fear that is instilled into most people by news organizations. 
Did you even read the material you're citing.  It substantiates my point, not yours, that NAFTA and Free Trade have been bad for the U.S.  It also substantiates my point that the rest of the world has benefitted economically at the direct expense of the U.S. and American people.    You don't appear to realize that you're selectively reading what you want to believe while ignoring the raft of economic evidence which undermines your position on Free Trade.  Read it again and pay particular attention to who is benefitting directly from the trade involved.  Thanks!  I'll be sure to add that to my list of evidence in the future.

There is insurance that will cover some political risk components. The World Bank sponsors MIGA, which will cover investments within MIGA countries up to a certain limit. They typically cover nationalization, expropriation, currency manipulation, and possibly civil and/political violence. But its not like health insurance, rather its more like a general business insurance policy. You still have legal recourse in addition to a possible insurance coverage plan.  If you Google "expropriation insurance" you can read some pretty interesting stuff. Its especially active in the energy sector since countries (I'm looking at you 2007 Brazil) like to try and nationalize or expropriate the oil and gas industry.
There's a difference between listening to someone's opinion and taking them seriously.
For the most part red states are welfare states.  They  receive more  federal benefits then they pay into the system. *we are now in our fourth decade of this imbalance*.  At this point conservative states have been a burden to the system for more than half of the time New Deal type legislation has been in effect.  On a consistent basis they vote against support for blue states, especially in federal disaster events.... But then they come crawling for help when it happens to them.   When you start interviewing them, you realize *they think they deserve the money*, the rest don't.  Combine this with the reality a majority of the leading edge economies originated in blue states, many red states simply are not pulling their weight.  Simple answer: my state created the iPod, Mississippi needs my tax money to buy them (as without those Fed funds their economy would be even worse and less folks could afford an iPod.)  You don't have to directly receive federal benefits to be a beneficiary.
I'm catholic, so naturally, I'm pro-life. That said, those are my own personal beliefs, and I wouldn't want to force people to be uncomfortable. That's why as far as laws go, I advocate pro-choice.
Actually, I am a businessman and a capitalist, I just hate falsehoods. I don't love all Democrats, but I refuse to vote for republicans who accept falsehoods like climate change denial and supply side economic theory. Look at my comment history for all my contributions in r/entrepreneur and r/startups if you don't believe me -- I take my capitalism seriously. It just so happens that I don't run a business that requires me to hire people for non-living wages. I don't actually blame CEOs for seeking out low taxes, I blame politicians for letting it happen.   Capitalism is a means to an end, not a natural law. Markets are great for most of the economy, but there are places where they fail. The bottom end of the labor market is one of them, which is why we need a minimum wage. Health insurance is another, which is why we need Obamacare, Medicaid, or another alternative other than pure unbridled competition. Pollution is another, which is why we need climate change policy. Security is one more, which is why we need armies and police departments. Relying on markets for everything is extremist and not supported by evidence.  I hope you can take the time to read some of the links and address some of my arguments. I don't think I'm getting anywhere right now, so I'm going to call this a day. Best wishes to you, we don't have to hate each other because we disagree.
What?  It doesn't say that at all.  Did you read the entire thing?  &gt;economists have been arguing about whether global trade is a net benefit or net cost; who are the winners and who are the losers. There has been lots of ink spilled on that issue. **The consensus from my perspective is that trade is generally a good thing; it helps to elevate the standard of living and it raises the level of economic activity on both sides.**
The smart people get turned down literally because their IQ isn't low enough for them to be a police officer. Those people are only allowed to work behind a desk, since their intelligence might cause them to do the right thing in a high-pressure situation.
Ahh the American left. Stupid people are victims of society, not victims of their own stupidity. Successful people are criminals and poor people never had a chance or a choice. Its a victim's culture. If you are the victim, you need not take responsibility for anything that happens to you. This is the American left. 
Can anyone imagine where we would be today were it not for the likes of Binney and Snowden? This shit would have been reauthorized weeks ago.

&gt;Might makes right?  Might determines what happens. That's how the world works. Might-makes-right is a moral judgment, and I'm not sure what it has to do with this discussion.  &gt;That is why we have police.  So they and others can push their will onto others with the air of political authority?  &gt;Really, your own bias is easily evident, and constructed out of faith, rather than science.  I don't deny having a bias. Nor do I claim my beliefs are completely based in reason. There's no one for which that isn't true. You're not saying anything important.  &gt;society at large has not only accepted the need for police, but embraced it.  OK, and how many of them came to that conclusion by thinking for themselves?  &gt;At least we can fire those people, given just cause.  How's that working out for you, you know, scientifically?  &gt;In your little fantasy land, YOU get impose your mental illness on others and call it 'liberty.'  If I were to do so, it would be as a private individual with no special right to do so. There's only so far I can really go. On the other hand, when sociopaths make their way into governments, they impose their will onto others and get away with it.  &gt;Fake patriotism is the calling card of adherence to faith, rather than principles.  I don't think I've ever been accused of espousing patriotism before, fake or otherwise. Where are you getting this stuff?
This is why trickle down is bullshit. 
Seems like most coverage is negative or scandal-laden (political, financial, etc.), which calls further into question how she can be so favored.
Look at the Mike Brown shooting. Ignorance and eating what the media feeds you made that into an issue. 
You seem to be confusing "reasonable doubt" with "possible." Can you give me any reason whatsoever to suspect that he was not born in Hawaii? Not "is it possible that he wasn't?" Do you have any reason whatsoever to even suspect.  It's possible that Inigo Montoyez is a real person, but I have no reason to suspect that he is, hence there is no reasonable doubt that he is fictional.   Because no one's trying to prove that it's impossible that Obama wasn't born in the US. That is indeed impossible to prove. There is just no reason whatsoever to suggest that there is no doubt. If there's no reason whatsoever, then doubt can't be reasonable.
The problem he has with the anti-trade agreement angle is that people want cheap shit. The minute you tell them "that home decor piece that you scored for $20 is now going to be $60, because we need good, high-paying jobs in America", they're going to get mad as hell and demand their cheap shit from China again.   Long story short, it's not evil corporations (as much as I like to blame them) sucking the middle class dry; it's globalization. There is a whole nation of people with a fuckload of work ethic who are willing to work for much cheaper than Americans. If we don't take advantage of that, another country will, and those are the facts we have to live with. Trying to impose draconian restrictions on our own imports will simply result in China exporting its goods to other countries and enriching the lives on those countries' citizens.
   Life's too short to spend a decade learning lessons that you will be paying interest on for the rest of your life.

&gt;In a 4-3 decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts' dismissal of the complaints against the District of Columbia and individual members of the Metropolitan Police Department based on the public duty doctrine. The Court explained that "****[t]he duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large****, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists." The Court adopted the trial court's determination that no special relationship existed between the police and appellants, and therefore no specific legal duty existed between the police and the appellants.  Emphasis mine   Maybe you should look it up.   Aside from that, it's a DC court of appeals finding, not a national finding.
Yes, blame the victims.  Are you not part of the electorate  too?  What should we do - fly onto the lawn of the White House in protest?  When you blame the victims you help the perpetrators, so please stop it.

Publicly. I am willing to bet American intelligence is well aware that Turkey is funding ISIS, and are fine with it. As long as ISIS gives them a reason to invade Syria, topple Assad and rebuild their presence there, it doesn't matter what they say publicly.
&gt;But capitalism needs property rights to function.  Too bad.  If you don't like the risk involved with investing in a sovereign foreign nation, then don't invest there.  Stay in your own nation where you're a citizen and have all the rights of one.  Why should you, a foreigner, get the same rights as a citizen in a foreign nation?  If the citizens of that nation decide to nationalize your industry, that's their right.

&gt;My point is that they are only pro-life under narrowly proscribed conditions, and curiously silent in other cases. It would be more accurate to say they are pro-birth.  Maybe so, but it's hardly an attack on their ideas to point out that the term used to describe them could be misinterpreted by people who are totally unfamiliar with the context. Everyone tries to frame their side as the morally righteous side, which is why pro-choicers call themselves pro-choice when they're so notoriously anti-choice when it comes to other issues aside from the abortion debate like economic issues.
You point out that there's not enough pro-life Catholics as a counterpoint. How is it their fault that there's not enough of them? There's a rising tide of people, religious or not, who are adopting pro-choice opinions. Why bash the small group that's actually decent for the fact that they're small?  I don't see how it helps a cause by being cynically divisive.
What is so special about stock trading that it would be destroyed by a transaction fee that is about 1/15th of the tax rate that is common for every other good and service?

If modest rises in the minimum wage achieved what you claim, we would constantly raise the minimum wage as a form of continual economic stimulus. Why don't we do that?
says the rich person 
This is a horrible argument. Yes, every person that votes or doesn't vote is part of the electorate. Unless the electorate changes the types of people they vote for, nothing will change.  This isn't a 'blaming the victim', it's 'blaming the people that continue to elect these people'. Unless the electorate actually starts to take their votes seriously, and vote for change, it will never happen.
You have a lot of preconceived notions about pro-life people that are grossly unfair.  1. Many are anti-capital punishment. Some that are pro-capital punishment would see it as justice for a crime, while the fetus has yet to do anything wrong.  2. What makes you think they aren't outraged by police killings? (Also, thousands a year? It's a few hundred, most years.) What makes you think the people protesting police brutality aren't pro-life?  3. There is plenty of outrage from pro-lifers when someone murders an abortion doctor. What makes you think there's not?  4. Wow, you really have a very specific idea of what a pro-life person is like, don't you? What a ridiculous leap to think that being pro-life means people are against sex education and birth control.  5. See 4.   Your conclusion is something you contrived based on your preconceived notions, and is downright ridiculous.
Actually that's his full legal name, Progressive Billionaire Nick Hanauer. He had it changed. He hates when you call him Nick.

Then it shouldn't matter to you who is on the note eitjer way.  This is a way to solidify we are a different country than we were before...that we grow and evolve and progress.
Seiously, 2 days later!  fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!
destroy the US middle class to build one in china, what could go wrong  yet another progressive in name only, just another RICH GLOBALIST FUCK 
Pro-choice/pro-life positions actually haven't been moving on the same progressive trajectory. In 2012, pro-choice sentiment was at its lowest since Gallup began asking the question in 1995, when pro-choice identification was far, far ahead of pro-life. [Here's the chart.](http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/lvpscaisx0-1lofvujngwa.png) Even now, it's not clear if this is a trend or just one of many jagged moves up and down. Polls are also [mixed](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/07/01/137079714/poll-generation-y-supports-gay-marriage-but-is-divided-on-abortion) on whether millennials are any more pro-choice than their parents. I'm not sure why this issue has decoupled from other progressive issues, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on as to whether things do now continue in a progressive direction or keep see-sawing.
defending Penn State takes the cake. Just goes to show his moral crusading on any issue is complete and utter BULLSHIT. Also "rock concerts" corrupting our culture is pretty funny. 
&gt; Domestic workers are employed in order to produce these goods which will be shipped overseas.  Perhaps I worded it wrong in my previous comment, but we were talking about employment.  
This is bullshit. It's a well known fact that decreased interest rates by the Fed caused investors like big banks to take on more risk, not deregulation.
The lawsuits should be paid out of the police officer's personal retirement fund.  And if that doesn't cover it, then you go to the 'general' police officer retirement fund, or it comes out what they get from the federal government in terms of equipment/funds.  Maybe if there are 'repeat offenders' who costs the police department more money than it's worth, then they are simply fired from the force. No questions asked. Gone. 
Uh...  Rand Paul?  He had a pretty public fight with Rubio about it back in december.  http://time.com/3642353/rand-paul-cuba-rubio-isolationists-just-dont-get-it/ 
They limited what you could win in a lawsuit against a doctor in Texas and insurance didn't really go down. If I weren't on the toilet I'd lookup the source.
This kind of behavior is what led the Bulls to fire Tom Thibodeau.
Reads nicely, but will never happen.
&gt;Pragmatism should define what we allow or don't allow with our laws, not judgement or opinion.  Even if you want to take the argument that things like welfare are practical, not just moral, liberals are for stronger gun control despite over whelming evidence that it doesn't reduce crime rates, murder or homicide rates, or other relevant statitics. The entire stance is emotionally based. This is why you see a surge of pro gun control measures every time a mass shooting takes place, and then nothing comes out of it. People get riled up by an anomaly that isn't even 1% of murder cases, and as soon as those emotions pass there is no facts or logic to stand on.  I'm not republican, but the left doesn't get a pass for their hypocrisy either.
Treating someone in the emergency room is not the same thing as treating a potential life threatening condition **before** it becomes necessary to call an ambulance. Someone who can't afford to get a stent for their heart takes little comfort in knowing that the hospital will make every effort to revive them **after** they've had a heart attack.  Learn to think.   
That's a good question. I'd hope not many.
I get your sentiment but I have a friend in police academy and they teach law driving and shooting. How to give tickets how to interact etc... I think the biggest problem is that once you're certified you only need to pass the shooting test again. Lot of older cops get complacent
I hate when people talk like you, in absolutes. In some areas he's better, some areas he's the same. In a lot of the major areas that are massively expensive, ignore our rights, and continue our meddling in other countries, he's very very similar. It's a valid criticism in many ways. No serious person says he's literally the exact same in every single way possible.

People need to stop hating irresponsible people. They need to put their money where their mouth is.   We need infastructure to support adoption. When a chick gets pregnant, if there's the local or not so local adoption agency that is trusted and tested to raise a child the best, then that's a huge plus to getting women to carry children to full term.  We need well advertised and local adoptions agencies. For retard kids too.  And then, all these pro life people need to make responsible decision, easier to make.   I strongly suggest every high school and college in the US provide free condoms. Always available in the hall or something.   Then some kind of program to make birthcontrol free and easily accessible.  Then we need a program for propaganda that makes these programs known so that sexually active and pregnant people can take advantage.
That's ridiculous. That would never work. Good thing the government knows *just the right amount* to choose as an arbitrary price floor that won't hurt employers. Who better to make these arbitrary figures than lawyers and career politicians who have never worked a day in the private sector and sure as hell haven't owned a business?  [note:sarcasm, I agree with you]   Their one sized fits all policies are sure to work the same way in cities like Seattle/San Francisco and small towns, why would there be any difference?
well, he is an outlier. depicting him as such would be an accurate representation. he is a fringe candidate with a cult following. the only reason he has had as much "success" as he has thus far in the race is simply because he is still the only officially declared primary candidate that isn't hillary.
The current American government has trouble compromising on many issues, this being one of them, I'm not suggesting a huge increase, but the productivity level of employees has increased every year and the minimum wage should reflect that and the increase in inflation.
Oh good. Now the capitalists can move back in and take over Cuba, make it all nice and touristy for rich Americans. 
"After checking and rechecking our sources we can confirm ggrieves said eldred2 said it was a verifiable fact.  Next up on the five, are liberals trying to have sex with your children?"
Speculation and conjecture without evidence.  You are going to be a star on reddit.
The problem with *that* argument is that everyone claims the electorate is uninformed, *yet they themselves are the exception to that statement*.   What is the result when every voter thinks their informed, but everyone else is uniformed? God forbid you actually be informed, cause then you're an elitist, and your spelling and grammar from smartphone typing gets scrutinized and becomes the focal point.
Saying he is better than the Republicans is hardly saying anything. Its similar to Alabama's "at least we aren't Mississippi." Both parties seem to have it in mind that bombing innocent Middle Eastern civilians is justified, and that CIA use of torture and spying on allies is also okay. 
It was a three way contest and Obama getting a large majority of the black vote contributed to most of that. 
Thomas Jefferson was a rapist. I don't think anyone can claim that a slave owner/slave sexual relationship is really consensual. So let's get him off the nickel and $2 bill. Frankly I don't think there's any reason for any of them to be on our currency. Why don't we showcase our ideals? Or beautiful American landmarks? Or our technological achievements?
True that many, or most people argue that should be the case on moral grounds.  There really are pragmatic reasons to try to run a smooth society, however.
Please tell me the difference between paying someone money to keep quiet about something you did and someone extorting you.
The middle ground is the most understandable. Almost anyone who draws a hard line on either side of the debate can be given a situation where they are not comfortable with the side that they have chosen. It is the most human and logical step to take into consideration each scenario instead of pretending that their is only one right solution that applies to every situation.
pro-life is such a stupid name for that side of the argument, you are taking life away from 3 people
And we have confirmed your interest in this subject has nothing at all to do with costs to students.  So thank you.
Were they tired of progressive liberalism? 
Dude... First of all talk about irony. You make a claim, dude asks for elaboration on what you meant, not specifically asking for sources, and you refuse to do so and call others lazy !? Wtf lol.    Secondly, you were asked to explain what you meant. You were not specifically asked for a source you just chose to interpret it that way, then you get all uppity and accuse others of misinterpreting you, you get defensive and say "it's not my fault you interpret my comment disparagingly", followed by a disparaging remark "you're lazy".  Now I imagine you will say something like " I don't care ", but if you engage in a discussion, there's gonna be like, I dunno, a discussion? Of you have an opinion and want to express it and be understood, you should expect to be questioned and be ready to explain it. That's just how communication works man. Of course you could just be aggro or trolling or hey of on conflict who knows...
Been a texan all my life. Have none of those things. Never will
Can't work while pregnant, but as soon as you pop it out, get your ass back to work.
*Are* housing and food far more expensive though? I haven't seen a well done approach that takes into account quality changes. Remember, the average home has increased in quality by a ton. The average square feet of a house has increased substantially and homes today have applianes that homes of yester-year did not. Food is much the same way. It was less than a century ago that you couldn't buy oranges year round at the grocery store.   http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/fed/annual/1999/ar97.pdf  This was done back in 1997 granted, but it didn't find any increase in home prices just considering the square feet argument, let alone the appliances or other quality improvements. It also didn't find increases in food prices. 
I vote yes.  This is a terribly written article, though.
Most voters don't think they're informed. Most don't give a shit. That basically erases your argument.
Was Rand Paul running in 2008/2012? 
Firstly, don't assume i'm a conservative. Secondly, you're fooling yourself if you think corruption in the white house is not bipartisan. And lets rememeber, this "Freedom" you speak of, is the freedom to kill children. I'd rather be Anti-choice than Anti-life. It's a no brainer. 
&gt;The Department of Justice on Thursday announced Hastert's indictment for agreeing to pay $3.5 million in hush money to keep someone quiet about his “prior misconduct.” ...The recipient of the money was a resident of Yorkville, Illinois, where Hastert taught high school and coached wrestling from 1965 to 1981.   I'm dying to know what Hastert did that he thought was worth $3.5 million to keep quiet. 
&gt; Any rights it may have may not override those of its mother  Is that true once the child is born?  If the fetus is human (with human rights), it has *equal* rights to the mother. If not, well then feel free to abort them all because then it is solely the mother's business. If it's some sort of 3/5ths human, well then that's another discussion.
They are what the GOP thinks American families really are. 
Fair question have you ever been to Texas?
&gt; Over half of americans own 0 stocks...  This excludes the 92% of public employees and 20% of private sector workers who have pension plans. The pension plan itself owns a substantial amount of stock and relies on gains to meet obligations.   CalPERS for instance manages $300 billion in assets for 1.6 million public employees in the state of California. Each one of those 1.6 million people are directly effected by increasing friction cost of stock sales. Especially since CalPERS traded **7.958 billion** shares in companies in 2014. At the median share price on the NYSE you are talking about a tax of $6 billion a year which is almost the entire amount that CalPERS paid in benefits for health care in 2014.
I think this was referencing the "Climate change will cause an increase in sever weather" not "Frakking will cause seismic activity which will cause flooding".  And there's definitely an argument to be made that the degree of rain is influenced by the increased temperature.  But degree of rain isn't such a big deal when you have solid drainage.  Folks living up on the hills in Austin weren't complaining about flooding.  Folks downstream, along the waterways of Central Texas... they're ones that got screwed.
This is at a time in which it's *really* in our interests to be a better-informed populace but I doubt the cost increase in information services versus real wages is as dramatic as increases in the cost of housing and transportation.
Pro-Life here: Just to clarify, we're not all against birth control, just the fetus-killing. I'm sure you can find some that are (Catholics, I think), but we're not generally anti-sex.
Its Free. So no one has to pay for it. 
Right? as a privileged white person everything is roses for you!  who cares ifyou fuck over your countrymen, you've got yours right!  there has been no middle class created anywhere in the world, you've only succeeded in transfering wealth out of our nation and into totalitarian regimes such as china, while the wealthy skim all the cream off the top contributing to record inequity  go live in china traitor 
&gt;on the Thom Hartmann show ... Just about as reliable a source as a politician.  
Why? Because it's a human life. You are challenging our recources more than a growing baby. If you care so much, respectfully, why don't you off yourself?  Also, no "crowd" can force you to have sex...that's a gang rape. And if killing children doesn't offend your morality, i'm sorry to say, but you might not be the best to speak about having morals.  Also, many people don't BELIEVE the earth is older than 6000 years old... So what? Science doesn't run on your belief system.      
&gt; A third of doctors have stopped accepting medicare patients.  Wrong. See here  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323971204578626151017241898  &gt;Meanwhile, the proportion of family doctors who accepted new Medicare patients last year, 81%, was down from 83% in 2010, 
The entire abortion debate is pathetic. I would say 80% of the time, people don't even know what pro-choice and pro-life mean.   "Pro-life" is anti-sex, anti-birth control, anti-woman zealotry...nothing more.
Saddened might be a better way to put it, but yes. Just less concerned than if it was Rand, for example.  Basically, damn near every candidate with their hat in the ring right now makes me concerned, save for Bernie.
Stocks that are very infrequently traded.
Impossible. [Here's just one recent example.](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/29/texas-flooding-caused-climate-change-witchcraft-sodomy.html)  Try to explain to her that the "sin of Sodom" was actually greed and not caring for the needy. 
To all of society. Prices on everything have dropped. Everyone (almost) is better off.  It's *possible* corporations do *better* but nobody (almost) is worse off.
With idiots like you supporting Sanders, who needs the GOP?
Better question: how many countries has Obama bombed? Liberals are so fucking hypocritical. Obama has bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. Liberals pretend to to be anti-war, but at the end of the day they apologize for murderous tyrants like Obama (and btw, drone strikes on average kill 20-25 people in collateral damage per targeted individual). Moreover, Obama's budget plan calls for **80 billion dollars more than the Republican proposal** in defense spending, topping the military expenditure to over 600 billion dollars. Obama looks more and more like Ghandi on a daily basis!  Also note, I am not a Republican so I am not defending Republicans. I'm just saying Democrats and Republicans are both war-mongering shit bags who suck Lockheed Martin's dick on a daily basis. Obama is a shit turd just like Bush.
They pay the iron price.
the trade agreement and income disparity are two separate issues. two important issues to be sure. but, citing resultant income discrepancy doesnt negate the fact that the trade agreement benefits the american economy. 
Fixed. Thanks. I was reading his post when i was typing!
&gt; Look at housing costs and tell me real wages haven't gone down.  The Dallas Fed looked at this in 97 and found that housing prices hadn't gone up after you adjust for square footage differences. (And didn't even *consider* the changes in appliances/quality)  http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/fed/annual/1999/ar97.pdf
Talk about a politically motivated hatchet job. This is fucking absurd. 
Ridiculous and unconstitutional, this old cunt needs to be kicked out.  Might as well require insurance for alcohol, medical drugs, and swimming pools since all of those are vastly more dangerous than firearms.
&gt; The problem in america today is that the electorate is too fucking retarded too call politicians out on these "double speak" fashion of naming bills.    Not even close. Most Americans are simply busy living their own lives; paying their bills, taking care of their families, working their jobs.  Most people work under an assumption that people are more or less doing what they should be doing,,,"I'll do my job and trust you are doing your job" as a first assumption, until proven wrong. It's not that they are stupid, or "fucking retarded"' it's just that they have more immediate concerns in their daily lives than to be political junkies...and they get taken advantage of for their trust
Yea, but how do you get stupid, poor americans to stop repeating what they see on reddit and spouting bullshit like this? 
Illinois as a whole is bad, not just Chicago. 4 of the last 7 governors went to prison. I guess it is 4 of 8 now since a new governor got sworn in recently.  http://abc7chicago.com/archive/8973798/
Who cares what the personification of "rape culture" has to say on any matter?
What an awful, pointless thing to do.

Ideology, lack of data, lack of will, or perhaps it would be less viable a strategy for their economy for any number of reasons. 
Good for you but that's what we call an outlier. 
I'm referring specifically to groups and their professed goals and policy statements and not to individuals. Nor do my statements deal in absolutes, but rather in tendencies that I've observed.
Quick question. Do you feel the same way about car insurance?
So long as you ignore the long term costs of using the most inefficient way to deliver medical care.  What costs more, heart medication to prevent a medical condition or heart surgery in the ER because you couldn't get preventative care?
I hope you realize that Gandhi, too, was a warmongering piece of shit, and incredibly racist to boot. He only refused to fight Britain with force because he had inside experience fighting for them in South Africa and knew how to best crack them.  This is why he is a giant shit bag in Civ games.
The stock market has never been higher, so I don't understand your comment. How would 401ks be empty right now? I can't even think of any possible way that your comment makes sense.
People take for granted just how much rich people control the press.  Do you own stock in a news corporation?  Who does?  Well?  Don't they have economic self-interests?  Aren't those often in opposition to the policies people like Bernie Sanders propose?  Of course they are.  We just like to paint ourselves a fairy tale reality where people do the right thing in regard to others and rather than the selfish thing for themselves.  That's often not how people operate and rich people don't get rich by compromising on their economic self-interests.  Also, think of the interests of the advertisers than can use their advertising money as leverage to inhibit coverage.

Knife owners too. Baseball bat owners also Tire irons. All hand tools. Arms, legs, the head (head butt liability.) Most any and everything out there needs liability insurance.  Edit: come to think of it, liability insurance is a right. Everyone should have government paid for liability insurance. Even the illegal aliens living here need liability insurance.
Mighty as well just come out from behind that thin veil of non-racism. 
Worth pointing out that Cuba was on the list for a reason. They used to actively and openly aid terrorists in Latin America. Those links have been greatly weakened over the years, but not entirely severed. Cuba probably should've been removed a few years ago, but it's not really comparable to jaywalking.
From my understanding Catholics are the ones who oppose contraceptives, not most evangelicals. Of course they all oppose the morning after pills etc, but I think the opposition to condoms and birth control is mainly catholics. It's all based on a weird misunderstanding of like, one verse in the Old Testament. 
"Big hat" is undefined. If your saying a cap... Yes everybody wears them in the summer because we don't want the sun to give us skin cancer. We are also talking an airport, on of the most diverse type of building there are you can't judge a place from a airport.
Thank you! This looks great. Cannot wait to dig in.
some towns/municipalities do require homes with pools to carry homeowners insurance which is perfectly fine because you don't have a right to a pool. Also distributors/retailers/servers of alcohol are required to carry liquor liability as a condition for a liquor license. But Considering owning a gun is an individual right as confirmed by SCOTUS (with certain limitations), I think this law is overstepping. 
&gt; GDP LOL like that has anything to do with real standard of living  Your own data which predicts a declining standard of living for American workers calculates that trend based on per capita GDP. My point is that GDP can't measure just how high our living standards have become. It's okay, though, I guess you're just too old to read and comprehend these days?
You started to look like a moron as soon as you tried to equate "liberals" with "Obama."  Obama is not a liberal. The Democratic Party is not a liberal party. Learn the difference.  &gt; I am not a Republican  Oooh, let me guess: Internet Libertarian?
[deleted]
That's not the discussion.
&gt; Good question. I would prefer government retraining programs. I suppose they could go to school (or go back to school) too.   Does the TPP fund that?   &gt; The "losers" still get cheaper goods and services so there's that too.  That doesn't help much after investors send your job to Vietnam or Mexico.  &gt; Well, more in regards to economic and political science principles. The TPP is par for the course when it comes to trade agreements. No real surprises. I'm not sure why everyone is getting so riled up over this, but hey, the masses can be pretty schizophrenic.  Perhaps because ordinary people see *past trade agreements* as *not having been in their favor*.  Even if we assume that TPP is simply more of the same, who cares? The public believes NAFTA was bad for working class Americans, even though economists promise it was also a "net gain" for the U.S. economy.  Nobody has given the U.S. working class a concrete reason to *support* the TPP. Perhaps such a reason doesn't exist.
I'd pose the same question to the user who told me I should go off myself for not agreeing with his warped religious views.
In all likelihood they probably consider women to be less than human, whether they're preggers or not, so they just won't treat them as well as regular people.  Gotta love when you have backwards-ass idiots in charge.
I am not sure if you missed the entire point, or are saying that the unborn has the right to live until it directly effects the mothers. I would wager that a decent number of "pro-life" people are against abortion, unless the abortion would save the mothers life, and the child has no chance at survival/ would be pre-mature. 
Right, but moving costs money and looking for work doesn't pay anything. I've never heard of a minimum wage employer providing time off to look for a new job, nor a severance to help pay for the move. And what landlord is gonna take your broke ass if you've got no job yet?
For humanity majors maybe. I think going to medical school is rather important so that the doctors know what they're doing.
I could site a dozen other studies, showing the same precipitous decline in standard of living...   this is not a controversial claim, but it doesn't fit with your neo-liberal reddit childish perspective  
A tax on financial transactions would be no different than any other sales tax anywhere in the economy.  Belief to the contrary is stupidity.  Your personal ideological beliefs won't ever negate that simple fact.  Your inability to understand the fact or to discover it on your own is relevant, especially while calling others ignorant.
The trouble is replacing blue collar jobs with white collar jobs doesn't help anyone who wouldn't already be looking for a white collar job.    Far more people need blue collar work that pays well enough to support families and drive consumer spending.  A good union also prevents outsourcing, by holding the company by the balls and making it very difficult for them to do so.  The government could also step in and tell companies that are thinking of selling out their employees and sending the work to those $5/hr Thai DBAs that if they want to do that, they should be prepared to not be able to do business in the US or have American customers or contracts.
different legal concept. And the parallel drawn between auto insurance requirements and accident rates is flimsy at best. We forget cars now have all types of advances in safety- shorter stopping distances thanks to ABS and sticker tires, traction control, stability control and so on...

No jury would fault an employee acting within his duties.  
That is really good. A 3 bedroom here was upwards up $1700 about 2 years ago. Now it's over $2500/month.
10% is a BIG chunk of money for states to cover, on something they wouldn't have covered in the first place. Medicaid expansion does not put new, formerly uninsured, on medicaid, but instead drives costs up that people who can't afford their previous coverage or lose jobs then get on medicaid.    The ACA is costing way more than projected, and will continue to do so. We were lied to, repeatedly. They had to pass the bill to see what was in it for a reason.    Back to doctors and patients, even with Medicaid, you won't necessarily be more proactive about prevention unless you are educated about it. Less doctors taking medicare patients means lines to see doctors, especially good ones. Doctors will be so packed, and starved for patients/payments, that they, and hospitals, will not take the time to educate on prevention, much less provide good treatment in the first place.    Just my take looking at both sides.
Yeah, I know.  I'm just saying the only people who benefited from it were the rich.    As with most of this crap.  
So we're thinking that Hastert called up his old lover and offered a $3.5 million payout to stay quiet? Not that his old lover showed up one day and demanded it?
Absolutely, it's horrible policy making in the red states, and even immoral, but on a simple economic basis it's also another screw up that will show up in economic and gdp charts down the road.
You know exactly what I mean by hat and airports have a lot of locals.  if you've ever been in even one of them. 
&gt;Obama is not a liberal. The Democratic Party is not a liberal party. Learn the difference.  Well according to the wikipedia article for the Democratic Party, they are in fact defined as liberal. And as leader of the Democratic Party, that would make Obama a liberal as well. I'm not sure what definition "liberal" has in your fantasy land, but feel free to let me know. You told me to "learn the difference" without actually providing me with an explanation of what "liberal" is supposed to refer to.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29#Ideology  &gt;Oooh, let me guess: Internet Libertarian?  No, I'm a Marxist/socialist/communist/futurist.
His stance that a unique human entity with its own unique human DNA should be entitled to individual human rights isn't that crazy.  It's a pretty liberal idea that is only trumped by the liberal mainstream idea that a woman's personal freedom trumps the unborn child's right to exist.  Thinking the (unborn) baby has rights is not super out there.  Even liberal democrats have pushed the idea of punishing someone extra if they assault/murder a pregnant woman because they "also assaulted/killed her unborn child."
Look at his history in office, what makes you think he will go back on his word when he gets the nomination?
If somebody actually thinks that NAFTA has benefited the American middle class, they simply need to look at cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids, Cleveland, etc... where we used to have a huge manufacturing presence.  Now we have nothing, and entire cities are going bankrupt due to overwhelming amounts of people in poverty.
I'm not surprised. Durable goods are a lot easier to trade than food. 
You don't have the word "fair" in their enough.
&gt; Considering treaties aren't generally concerned with domestic happenings, it's almost tautological that it wouldn't. I highly recommend writing your Congressman and Senators about this.  So you agree it's not happening then. In which case the TPP *does not have my support and does not deserve the support of the people who will lose under its provisions*.  &gt; Nope. But once you find a new job, even if it pays less, you'll be doing alright.  Somehow, I don't see the business interests who *definitely* do win from these deals taking a hit for the greater good.  &gt; The government can deal with this much better through retraining programs than by simply ignoring free trade and its benefits.  I suppose I'd consider supporting further TPP negotiations if funding for such training was part of the bill. But they're not, so that's purely academic.  &gt; Well the economists are right.   In a way that is, at best, meaningless. People have noticed decades of stagnation in real median U.S. wages.  *If* NAFTA and other trade agreements were a large net positive for the U.S. working class, then proponents could easily demonstrate it. But their silence on the subject speaks volumes.
Guns are the only thing in your list that isn't covered by insurance. Taking another's life on drugs or alcohol would probably involve your auto insurance, and your pool is covered by your homeowners insurance. 
This is the one reason I will never vote for a Democrat again. I am all for gay rights, abortion, etc. I will never vote for a group that tries to take my rights from me. 
&gt; Why is it that men have to pay for their mistakes, but women get a mulligan?  Why is it too late for men to have an opinion/say in the matter?  Frankly the problems you describe are a result of reckless, unprotected sex outside of a trusting relationship.  Why is it too late for men to have a say in the matter?  Because you've actively decided to fuck someone without a condom and without the safety of an open, trusting, communicative relationship.  That was your opportunity to have a say in the matter.  Women can mulligan neither boils, blisters, nor warts.  This reason alone is enough to wear a rubber.  And if you're not wearing a rubber, it's because you're in a trusting relationship and never have to worry about what will happen in the event of pregnancy *because you've already talked about it with your partner.*
How exactly am I supposed to obey a secret law if I don't know what it is or it's scope?  How are the police supposed to enforce it?  How are lawyers supposed to argue a case that involves it?  How is this not some Gestapo bullshit?
I'm with the liberals on this one. Too many stupid people having babies in America. Pro Choice all the way
I would assume it's due mostly to birth rates

Denmark is a socialist welfare type country. Little immagration along with its capital city being on an island makes it easy to run. It however is not up next to another country with tons of immagrants. Also taxes are super high in Denmark. So if you like to watch people sit back on welfare while you pick up the tab as the taxpayer, then sure it would be great.
It is, but socialism/communism are basically the same thing. I just add in that I'm a Marxist because there are too many "Sweden is socialist and so am I" people out there...who erroneously identify as being socialist without ever even glancing at Das Kapital. And futurism because technology is the primary means by which we can improve the human condition.
Under NAFTA, Ethyl Corp sued the Canadian government and forced them to repeal an import ban on MMT. MMT is considered a toxin and is banned by the EPA. That's something middle class people care about.
This might get a whole heap of downvotes, but does it absolutely *have* to be a woman on currency redesigns? If you're going to put a Civil Rights leader on the bill, I'd much rather see Martin Luther King Jr.
**DING DING DING**
Why is it worse for a woman to be pro-life than for a man?   Either way it comes down to the rights of the fetus vs the rights of the mother, I don't see why your gender would have anything to do with how you balance those.
Go on... Why?
Do you even know if they got any government support or are you just speculating?
&gt;For the love of god can someone post anything in this sub that isn't something Bernie Sanders farts out every fifteen minutes?   Go right ahead!
&gt; It's not that they are stupid, or   "fucking retarded"'   You obviously have never met the type of people who vote for people like Ted Cruz and Lamar Smith.   I have met quite a few, all of which I can claim are borderline mentally retarded.    
Says you, based on faith and no evidence.
Of course he's hot. Uncle Bernie plans to win by buying votes, from the mostly selfish kids, with money he robs from taxpayers! "Free' college baby!
Or lack of good education. 
&gt; Please don't think everyone who's against abortion is a hypocrite.  When the people you vote for are, why shouldn't I?
By the time we know, it will already be law... There is a reason they want to keep everything a secret until it is signed...
Thanks for reminding me to plan my next vacation spot.
&gt; if they have to kill an active shooter and a stray bullet or ricochet kills an innocent civilian police should not carry this cost personally  The problem there, as the police have shown us, is that if you give them an escape clause, they will abuse it like a pubescent male.  See "Resisting arrest" "Interfering with the investigation", etc...  If they choose to use lethal force, and hit an unintended target, then they should pay.   Hence, insurance.    If it happens once, okay.. insurance will probably pay out begrudgingly... if they KEEP "accidentally" hitting bystanders, then their rates will go up, and they'll either be priced out of the job, learn to aim better, or not be so ready to use lethal force.  Really, should extend that to tasers too.    Too many cops think not respecting them is a crime.
Everybody has moral values they force on others. For social conservatives, it's Christian stuff. For liberals, it's stuff like environmental conservation, anti-discrimination legislation and affirmative action, animal rights, etc. Authoritarians always try to impose their will on others.
Yeah, I posted a link elsewhere of that information, saying I was wrong.   It's still wrong to accuse someone of the act, without the evidence being there.
It makes us Texans morally superior to all y'all hand out sucking but otherwise healthy people. 
Everyone wants an oppressor to fight.
Lol. I found the predictable redditor who can be manipulated like a puppet. You're a politicians dream voter.
Haha.  If that was the case I'm a bored rich man.  
A big part of it is that it's become clearer and clearer what the real agenda of the "pro-life" movement is.    It certainly isn't to save lives because we have double the per capita rate of maternal death of Saudi Arabia.  Many pro-lifers are offended at paying taxes to support these precious lives, so if these babies die in birth/starve/die of preventable disease, it's not a big deal to the people weeping over them when it meant beating up on mommy.  The whole movement is just so clearly mean-spirited and ugly.  Ugly laws, hypocritical double standards for when they or their gfs/wives/mistresses need abortions and the fact that many of these people are anti-education and anti-birth control.
Do you think the lower 40% of this country (concerning wealth distribution) could afford anything else?  Look at how much a pair of shoes made 100% in the US from 100% US materials costs.
Just in the home or does it follow you?   Just curious because here in La. there are all kinds of insurance you can buy for your conceal carry. 
Sure, but if I just offer to give you money in return for your keeping something quiet without any threat from you, you're not extorting me.  We don't know which was the case here.
NSA already probably had dirt on him at the time (along with bunches of others, and whoever they didn't have dirt on they intimidated with the Anthrax letters) and got the patriot act passed that way. Then after new admin finally wrangles control of NSA from last admins' remaining operatives and with new AG, pull the trigger on delayed justice.  We have to seriously ask ourselves how many of our representatives are being blackmailed by associates, businesses, foreign countries, or even *blackmailed by the NSA for being blackmailed by someone else.*  These talking head candidates that come on TV and repeat the NSA line verbatim "Important programs, save lives, freedom freedom, men and women at NSA do a great job, different type of enemy" you know the drill, these guys are, I can't help but believe, fully controlled by the NSA.   It is entirely plausible that the entire electoral system is manipulated such that one cannot even secure a party's nomination without being indebted or blackmailed in some form as an assurance of loyalty to whatever designs for our government and society the NSA shadow government has in mind.  In short, this is not democracy, not even a republic. This is a farce. A show. Ran by shadowy white men behind the scenes that no one can even identify. The politicians are puppets and actors, and we should ignore any of them that aren't *fully* committed to freedom and liberty in their words and actions.
&gt; In today's terms, he paid $230 million...and doubled the size of the U.S.  That's a bit deceiving. The US at that time was a tenth the size of it was and the US budget at that time was tiny compared to what it is now. You can do a straight inflation comparison because the US changed so much since then.  &gt; Could he have taken it for free?  Yes. No question about it. That's why the french sold it because they were scared we or the british would simply move in and take it.  &gt; Probably, because Napoleon didn't really want it anymore  It's not that he didn't want it anymore. It was that he couldn't defend it anymore. There were like 10 frenchmen in the entire territory with tens of millions of indians. It was as much "french" territory as moscow is my city because I claim it.   &gt; there's like 10 states in the LA Purchase  So what?   &gt; and at a price of $.04 per acre.  Which was a rip off.   &gt; A pretty sweet deal if you ask me  Paying for something that's free is a "pretty sweet deal"? You are insane.
your personal liability coverage attached to your homowners insurance follows you worldwide. Also, most homeowner's policies cover the actual GUN against loss (theft, fire, etc), but with a limit of 2,500 or so. That part of it applies only within the US... What kind of insurance is offered for CC? If you already have homeowner's insurance it MAY be redundant... 
lol I hope he wins the Democratic nomination just so we can see all the outrageous attack ads that basically say just this.
What a kooky lady, it frustrates me when elected people submit legislation on political grounds that have very little to do with reality. Deaths have dropped cause cars are safer, possibly via some legislative acts , but more so cause the auto makers realized the profit to loss margin was improved as less people were killed by the machines. I kinda agree with a legislative mandated insurance poll-tax/fee for owning a firearm, I do not like such shenninagans, so just un-elect that person, please. 
Good to see the fuck you me first attitude isn't limited to one income bracket.
You can blame republicans all day (and you're 99% right),  but lets not forget who bailed these banks out with our tax dollars when their fuckup karma came back around...  GOOD 'OL BARRY'O  Edit: Sorry I insulted your prince.  Are you glad he used your and my tax dollars to reward these banks for their shady and destructive business practices?  If so PLEASE elaborate 
&gt; Everyone tries to frame their side as the morally righteous side, which is why pro-choicers call themselves pro-choice when they're so notoriously anti-choice when it comes to other issues aside from the abortion debate like economic issues.  Um, it doesn't really speak to the strength of your argument when you have to specifically loop in entirely unrelated things to argue against the pro-choice name. 
I actually have been fortunate enough to have been to the DFW airport several times. And if you mean cowboy hats, I don't know who you thing you are kidding. Anybody wearing one of those would be on horseback to go where they want... And lets get to another point "enough spite to blow the dust off of your nose." Ok, once again obviously you have never been to Texas beyond an airport visit... You contradicted yourself by saying they have a bible and spite. If you follow the morals in the bible (which you should be reading if you own, if not you wasted money) you should never hold hate someone to the point of harming them. And last point, I have been to all places of the US (Seatle, New York, Chicago, Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana) and not just a airport visit and the only other type of people that I find close to being as nice is the Arkansas people (except when you bring up race the ones I've met are pretty racist.)
&gt;This trade deal is going to decrease US GDP  Lols citation definitely needed. 
&gt;2) the collapse of the unions both in power and due to a lot of manufacturing leaving America. No growth in unions or support for higher wages outside of them.  I won't work for a unionized company.  Nope.  No thank you.  
Yeah, that whole "Sorry, we think those are actually people and we're not gonna let you own them anymore" was pretty damn judgmental of them, wasn't it?  Like, who are they to impose their morals on us?  If you don't like slavery, just don't own slaves!  
Punishment probably wasn't the best choice of words.  You have two people in the situation: man, woman. Man and woman did something that introduced a third person to the situation. Now: mother, father, baby. With abortion, the mother and/or father decide to kill the baby. Man and/or woman took actions that resulted in the third person being introduced, so they should have to deal with the consequences, not the third person.  This is all going with the "fetus is human" side of the debate. If fetus is not human, then abort it, I don't care.
I'm liberal and don't give a shit about gun control. I do think people that are gun obsessed and think we need to have them everywhere are assholes, but that has nothing to do with laws.  We can't have anti asshole laws or we will lose 3/4 the population.
Unfortunately its the poor who reproduce quickly. Its not a sustainable cycle.

If a mother or father stop feeding and caring for their children, we charge them with neglect and may put them in jail or take away their children. 
So that entitles you to have kids and then complain that you can't afford it? Should I go get a car I can't afford because credit approval is easy and then complain that I can't make payments and that it is unfair that the rest of america can, like I am owed that for some reason?
Policy that directly impacts trade 
You seem very naive for someone that has traveled a lot. You can't be spiteful if you have a Bible? Wat?
Yeah but thats the problem. What happens to the slow guy in the class. Is he just fucked because capitalism yeah!?!  If someone can't do the skilled labor he won't have a job. So what do we do about the stupid people? Are they destined to live under bridges? No one ever addresses this problem. Bootstrapping doesn't exist anymore.

Like, who are they to impose their morals on us? If you don't like slavery, just don't own slaves!   Sorry, Republicans gave up that particular mantle when they embraced the southern strategy of taking in the sad southern Democrats who fled the party after the civil rights act was passed.
&gt; For ***liberals***, environmental ***conservation***  Alright...   
I keep hearing this argument. "It hasn't been a problem yet." As though that makes a bad idea good. Sure, the most egregious imaginable outcome has yet to manifest, and may never. That's not really a sound argument on which to base rules/laws/policy. This system is rife for exploitation in a world where many corporations have more liquidity than most countries in the world.
CEO pay increasing exponentially in recent decades is partly due to the Fed pumping money into the system to levitate the stock market (CEO pay is tied to share price performance).   John Maynard Keynes said that one of the primary drivers of wealth disparity is monetization of debt which transfers the public's wealth to the elite capitalist class that own the nation's assets:  &gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ess_inflation.html  &gt;Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but [also] at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.  &gt;Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become "profiteers," who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.  &gt;Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.   &gt;In the latter stages of the war all the belligerent governments practiced, from necessity or incompetence, what a Bolshevist might have done from design. Even now, when the war is over, most of them continue out of weakness the same malpractices. But further, the governments of Europe, being many of them at this moment reckless in their methods as well as weak, seek to direct on to a class known as "profiteers" the popular indignation against the more obvious consequences of their vicious methods.  &gt;These "profiteers" are, broadly speaking, the entrepreneur class of capitalists, that is to say, the active and constructive element in the whole capitalist society, who in a period of rapidly rising prices cannot but get rich quick whether they wish it or desire it or not. If prices are continually rising, every trader who has purchased for stock or owns property and plant inevitably makes profits. By directing hatred against this class, therefore, the European governments are carrying a step further the fatal process which the subtle mind of Lenin had consciously conceived. The profiteers are a consequence and not a cause of rising prices. By combining a popular hatred of the class of entrepreneurs with the blow already given to social security by the violent and arbitrary disturbance of contract and of the established equilibrium of wealth which is the inevitable result of inflation, these governments are fast rendering impossible a continuance of the social and economic order of the 19th century. But they have no plan for replacing it....  &gt;The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to extraordinary lengths. The various belligerent governments, unable or too timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the resources they required, have printed notes for the balance. In Russia and Austria-Hungary this process has reached a point where for the purposes of foreign trade the currency is practically valueless. The Polish mark can be bought for about [three cents] and the Austrian crown for less than [two cents], but they cannot be sold at all. The German mark is worth less than [four cents] on the exchanges....  &gt;But while these currencies enjoy a precarious value abroad, they have never entirely lost, not even in Russia, their purchasing power at home. A sentiment of trust in the legal money of the state is so deeply implanted in the citizens of all countries that they cannot but believe that some day this money must recover a part at least of its former value.... They do not apprehend that the real wealth, which this money might have stood for has been dissipated once and for all. This sentiment is supported by the various legal regulations with which the governments endeavor to control internal prices, and so to preserve some purchasing power for their legal tender....  &gt;The preservation of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of law expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however, the seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of ultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his labors for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to purchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has received for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself, dispose of it to his friends and neighbors as a favor, or relax his efforts in producing it.  &gt;A system of compelling the exchange of commodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes production, but [also] leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter. If, however, a government refrains from regulation and allows matters to take their course, essential commodities soon attain a level of price out of the reach of all but the rich, the worthlessness of the money becomes apparent, and the fraud upon the public can be concealed no longer.  &gt;The effect on foreign trade of price-regulation and profiteer-hunting as cures for inflation is even worse. Whatever may be the case at home, the currency must soon reach its real level abroad, with the result that prices inside and outside the country lose their normal adjustment. The price of imported commodities, when converted at the current rate of exchange, is far in excess of the local price, so that many essential goods will not be imported at all by private agency, and must be provided by the government, which, in re-selling the goods below cost price, plunges thereby a little further into insolvency....  &gt;-John Maynard Keynes  Edit: To the haters, why don't you try making a valid counterpoint? It's ridiculous how ignorant some people here are that factual information gets downvoted **just because it doesn't fit your narrative** while the thread circlejerks about non-issues.   
I asked if you acknowledge that there needs to be laws regarding this. I did not ask if there was a minimum wage.  No wonder this is taking two hours. You won't answer the questions I ask.  (and they are fairly direct) 
I wasn't making a judgement, just an observation
&gt; the parents' actions--not those of the fetus--are what caused this human to come into existence.  Right, that's punishing people for having sex.  &gt; why do the mother and father get to force two cells to become a human?   Because that's what biology does regardless of how the parents feel about that.  &gt; What if that human didn't want to exist?  How did you feel about existing when you were 10 weeks old inside your mother's uterus?  You didn't because your brain wouldn't be developed enough to understand that concept for years to come.  You're imbuing an adults intelligence onto a blastocyst.  &gt; I'm not arguing that the rights of the fetus override the rights of the mother  Yes you are.  If you say a woman cannot have an abortion you are overriding her rights in favor of the fetus.  You are forcing another human to use her body without her consent.  &gt; This is a flawed analogy because it was not the actions of the fetus that caused the unwanted occurrence.  If you deny a woman an abortion, then it's the actions of the mother responsible (her having sex) and you're punishing the mother (having a child she doesn't want), so the analogy holds.

Ross Perot was right all along!
He's the only president to ever have pay off the national debt. There are some positives. 
&gt;So you agree it's not happening then. In which case the TPP does not have my support and does not deserve the support of the people who will lose under its provisions.  Perhaps. But then it will most certainly pass since the vast majority benefit.  Regardless, government action will always benefit some more than others (or perhaps even at the expense of others). So what should the government do? Nothing? Who deserves to suffer?  &gt;Somehow, I don't see the business interests who definitely do win from these deals taking a hit for the greater good.  Naturally, firms are different from labor. That's all I got there. Some firms will be hurt though, likely because foreign firms are more efficient. Story for another time.  &gt;I suppose I'd consider supporting further TPP negotiations if funding for such training was part of the bill. But they're not, so that's purely academic.  They literally couldn't be part of the bill. Treaties don't work that way. But you're right I suppose.  &gt;In a way that is, at best, meaningless. People have noticed decades of stagnation in real median U.S. wages.  "People have noticed" is meaningless. Please show me the statistics that real median household wages have been stagnant or flat. You'll find they hardly follow a straight line at all but are on a general upward trajectory.
He's not an isolationist.  I imagine a trade agreement that he would be into would be one that addressed the issue of corporations using US infrastructure paid for by US taxpayers and then exporting their profits and paying nothing in taxes.  The issue here isn't free trade vs restricted trade, it's corporations wanting to have their cake and eat it too vs corporations paying their share for using the infrastructure provided by the US to realize profits.
Texan here, did NOT vote for Cruz and I definitely  do not like him or the things he does representing my state. That being said, his opposition to the Sandy relief was due to the non-hurricane related spending that was inserted into the bill. He and several senators said they did not oppose disaster relief and would support it if it didn't come with all of the other BS funds.   Don't like the guy, but I happened to agree with him in that circumstance. Read the article before commenting, but fuck Ted Cruz anyway. 
I beg to differ had he not been snubbed by the media.
I can be okay with restrictions on abortion after a certain point in legal language, but the ultimate counter to me is that those restrictions never come with any caveats for the woman. If those restrictions came solely from the viewpoint of secular advocates who are interested in maintaining life on both sides, I would understand, however- they normally come at the expense of the mother to protect the child. Who is to make that judgment? I don't think it's the place of the law, that's for sure.  Let me clarify a little bit, in case I've been unclear. If abortion is illegalized for after 25 weeks, fine- but in cases of incest or rape, or where the birthing process will threaten the mother's life, there should be exceptions. Instead, those laws are made with absolutely no value to the mother's life at all. Someone in one of these threads last week cited a case in Texas where the mother was left to die on the operating table after the fetus was pulled out. What the fuck?? Saving a baby's life is important, if they have the technology and capacity to do so, but so is saving a mother's life. Terminating a mother's life in order to save a child is just as equally tantamount to murder.
Complicated answer. First, their care is not better. Their care for a smaller less diverse population is more average. Meaning we have the best, and the worst. The world's richest people fly into Cleveland or NYC for specialized care, while no matter how much free medicare you give a poor, uneducated person in America, they will often still not make the best life choices when it comes to obesity or preventative medicine.    If you simply open up state lines for insurance and create actual competition for your dollar, instead of a system that was designed by insurance company lobbyists to increase profit, care will improve and hopefully people will be more aware of their health than expecting the best care as a right.
This.  And the cost of the land.
If you actually cast a vote for a Republican or Democrat, then by definition you are uninformed. Both parties are being double penetrated by the giant corporate cock.  This is more obvious now than ever to anyone that pays attention.  If you vote for a Republican or Democrat you are allowing the racket to continue.   There are a few outlier politicians that actually call out the bullshit, but they are silenced by the mainstream media who is profiting nicely off the status quo as well.
I would rather this whole thing get swept under the rug than be forced to imagine Dennis Hastert having sex.
He was dead wrong and contemporary readings of the time will enlighten you.  Jackson the Indian Killer and Slave Raper should not be exalted.
If ordinary folks are doing well the conservatives scream they are just ignorant theives fleecing the deserving wealthiest who have been scammed by those liberal politicians.   When the billionaires are doing well it is economic theory, no matter how crackpot the lies such as those Trickling Down Laffer Curves. 
You aren't explaining it because you can't.  I have probably been in the market for longer than you have been alive and have forgotten more about finance than you will ever know so spare me your condescending dodges.  Person A sells asset with value X to person B.  Person C collects some percentage of the value X.  This is an accurate description of sales tax on any good whether it be a stock or a can of soda.    It is also an accurate description of what every bank or broker currently does when making trades for clients.  Unless of course you are saying things like transaction fees and exspense ratios don't exist.  The only difference is that person C in one case is the bank or broker and in the case of a tax it's the government.  The liquidity tripe all the shills walk out is just that.  The current level of market liquidity is measured in fractions of a seconds.  The only thing in the entirety of the economy that requires liquidity at that rate is trading for tradings sake.  Essentially your argument, boiled down without pretense or obsfucation, is that high frequency trading requires liquidity to support high frequency trading.  Companies don't need split second liquidity for anything other than trading.  Real investment requires time.  Buying new equipment takes months or years.  Hiring people takes weeks.  Building new infrastructure takes time.  Even starting R&amp;d takes time.  The only thing in the economy that requires our current level of liquidity is speculative trading.  You are never removing liquidity from the market, you can slow the rate, but the money doesn't disappear.  The government taxes some amount, that amount doesn't disappear, it comes back into the market when the government spends it.  Liquidity for liqudities sake is harmful and counter productive.  If stopping liquidity is bad, then no money should ever leave the market, including fees by banks for making trades.  Liquidity is like any other thing in the universe, too much is just as bad or worse than too little.  Fyi, too much liquidity is more often the cause of bubbles.  When you have massive assets you see massive movement of those assets chasing the biggest returns.
Super Nice Title Is Super Nice.
Because it would be a tax on transactions and not on gains   For example, let's say you use scottrade and want to buy 100 shares of XYZ corp at $3 and then sell at $4  Normally here's how it would work  Scottrade charges you $7/trade so you pay $307, sanders would then tax you an additional .5%.   Stock rises and you sell at 4. You receive: 400-7  So in total you earned. $86 (393-307).  You would then get taxed on that $86 and your total earnings would be the $86 minus the tax  What sanders wants to do is to charge you, like scottrade, every single time you make a transaction. And not just a fixed united, but a percentage. You have to remember that millions and millions of transactions happen every day.  Now in scenario I just described: you wouldn't hurt as bad. But remember we have losses in trading   So imagine the stock went from $3 to $1.   The sanders tax would still tax you even when you lose money. This would be disastrous and halt trading.   Remember a bank like Goldman Sachs makes over 10,000 trades every second. They trade so many instruments not just stocks and options. 
Can't believe I left that off the list when it's such a core part of the GOP ideology.
The other reason that "Don't like them, don't get one." doesn't work is that many conservatives actually want to outlaw them for everyone else under the well known 'the only moral abortion is my abortion' clause.   
I'd like to know where they get that number from. I'm single and make significantly more than the average American *household*, and my effective federal tax rate last year was something like 5 or 6 percent.  Maybe they are throwing in SSI, state taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, etc?
Yeah why the fuck would I want my doctor to have gone to medical school.  He could just stay home and google that shit for free.  
Poor people don't usually move. Unless you are talking about immigration.
Yeah, in a bad way.
Your opposition to the TPP is that some people will lose their jobs and be uncompensated right?  Thats a byproduct of trade with other countries, there is nothing about this deal that is different from the others in this regard.
And all I'm saying is that "forc(ing) 'moral values' on the nation" is not an inherently bad thing.
I really think naming rights should be given to the bill's opponents. Then we'd either see some civility, or (more likely) get some really entertaining bill names.
Your shit is still heavy establishment, Sanders. That's my problem. You want to sit back and see what comes of legalization in Colorado? You're waiting to see the pros and cons before you decide?  News Flash; that outs you. You're a politician. You just say things people want to hear. If you have to sit back and think on it real hard? Then you're waiting to see which way the wind blows. And that's the shit Obama did to us in '08. Now he's trying to renew the Patriot Act because "omfg we might actually catch somebody with it while it's expired *[fear-mongering intensifies]*."  Fucking politicians. Your cult of personality gives you the illusion of success, and that's unfortunate for people looking for true progress.
They probably didn't believe you. I didn't. It runs contrary to the *ve vant to ve everyving Sveden vecause everyving iv vo vondervul* script. 
Yah I know I'm just saying it's hard to really put them on the same level 
Li'l bit late to the party, Esquire.
The discussion is whether or not progressives are forcing people to conform to their morals.  The benefits are irrelevant.
When people pay you millions of dollars to make graphics, it's kind of easy to criticize other people whose job is trying to solve the most complex problems in the world while people are screaming at you that you are an 'anti-christ socialist muslim'.   Grow up Shepard.    
This is a load of bullshit. Revisionist armchair assholes want to take shots at one of the best presidents who served this country.   Fuck all that.
We don't want their dirty horse-water!
You know what-  I'll simply settle for a Republican that isn't a giant asshole.  A republican that recognizes that being educated, or poor, or not white does NOT make you any less of an American would be a great fucking start.  
Okay, but are you really arguing that Saudi Arabia treating it's legal wives and mothers with more decency and respect than America is, is okay?  You can argue about whether the numbers are 100% accurate or not or you can take a step back and realize how ugly and stupid the anti-choice movement has become.  Rick Perry, for example, illegally blocked federal funds earmarked for women's health clinics including some that didn't even provide abortions so he could appear to be an even bigger champion of life.  
So conservatives want to legislate what private individuals do where only parties directly involved are affected. Liberals in cases where there is far-ranging and/or wide-spread effect . Yes?
Feel free to assume what you want, it doesn't make your Randian tautology nonsense any more cogent. 
Jefferson needs to go to. He was just as terrible.   Grant on the other hand beat the shit out of succession, so I vote he stays and elect William Tecumseh Sherman as the 20 note.
If you are honest with yourself you would have realized you don't understand much of anything and were dismissed several messages ago.
Yay social conservatives are dying out!!  Is it because Christianity has shown its true colors and ugly side far too many times thus pushing people away?   Is it cause people are tired of Christian conservative hypocrisy or because a lot of women use the pill and have had abortions so it's difficult for women to criticize their friends like it's hard for a conservative to hate gays after finding out the child stormed out of the closet l?
Actually the topic was about philosophy/ideology, not your personal opinion about others. If you want to do that, there is always /r/liberalcirclejerk or /r/feels. However, if you want to talk about a philosophy, then simply calling it childish or uneducated only shows you to be the childish and uneducated one for refusing to discuss the subject matter. 
Unfortunately they are going to be very disappointed when the primary ends.  I love the message and really believe he would live up to it in office if he got the chance, but being realistic his chances are almost nil unless Clinton drops out of the election for whatever reason (scandal, health crisis) which is highly unlikely given how much effort has already been spent digging up dirt on her family.  I'll sing his praises, vote for him whenever possible, and wish him the best, but he isn't going to be our next president.
Human rights versus religious preferences are two different things, no?
Waitaminnit...are you saying forcing moral values on the nation was the right and proper thing to do?  Weird--the poster I was responding to appeared to be very much against that sort of thing.
It only takes a prayer 1 light year to reach Heaven but it gets routed to the warehouse and there's a huge backlog.

Yeah those are not the same. One is about doing things to yourself and one is about doing stuff to others.   Should I be able to dump poison into your home? Of course not, so why should companies be free to do so?  
&gt; and there is no greater violation of individual rights than to deny life.  Violating someone's freedom is a greater violation than denying them the right to life.
Meh, it's just a flippant response to a lot of activities I see in the news. Seems like there are entire groups of people that believe women shouldn't be making their own decisions, or should to be treated equal to men in general.  After awhile i just get burned out and start assuming these terrible opinions are held by the parties responsible for creating and support these laws/rules/social norms and such.
He's a fringe candidate because he is significantly less well known than the front-runner and has low enough poll numbers to make his chances at winning the primary effectively zero.  There is no way to spin his actual situation as more than a fringe candidate until his poll numbers show he can take a significant number of primary elections/votes off of the front-runner.  Love the guy, plan on voting for him, plan on talking about his ideas with friends, but he's still a fringe candidate.
"Follow your dreams," they said. "Literature is a *fine* major," they said. :P
He isn't really mainstream and as much as his supporters talk about how there is some big media conspiracy to make him less visible to most voters, that doesn't make it true. He also is not Barack Obama, for so many reasons, both positive and negative, and he isn't going to gain enough to get even close to Clinton in the primary. This isn't just opinion, every poll and every reasonable analysis shows this. Even the mainstream people who want Sanders to have an affect on the discourse, say that he has absolutely zero chance.
I will gladly elaborate. First of all, the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that while the Republicans have NO ONE interested in helping out the middle class and the poor, the Democrats have Barry Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and a few others. Maybe half a dozen in Congress, total. But that still puts them well ahead of the Republicans.  Second, Obama's bailout was a success. Its intended goal was to halt the tailspin the economy was in and to help the economy recover fast. It did that. It also got the banks out of the mess they had created, but that was a side effect. Also, most of the money given in the bailout has been paid back.  Where Obama failed was in not also helping out all the middle class and poor homeowners who were hurt by the crash. Obama and his Democratic colleagues little or nothing to help out average Americans in that respect. There was a fund set up to help middle class homeowners, but it wasn't a big fund in relation to the banks, it was very slow to pay out and didn't actually get much done. A halfhearted effort, at best, of which Obama and the Democrats should be deeply ashamed. What's more, if the Democrats and/or Obama HAD made a real effort to help middle class homeowners, you can be SURE that the Republicans would have been howling like dogs about the expense of it.  Obama's deepest failure may have been in the area of justice: his justice department, presumably under his orders, refused to criminally prosecute any individuals for what they had done. They just prosecuted bank buildings and fined them what was for them small change. This was a huge moral failure on Obama's part, basically saying "It's OK to be a criminal if you're a big enough criminal." I was disgusted by it. And I know why it happened: Democrats like Wall Street campaign contributions just as much as Republicans do. In that respect, both parties are identical, with the exception of a handful of Democrats (Sanders, Warren and friends.)
Yet religion is dying as a whole. So fuck em. 
I think you misunderstand what I meant.  I don't mean "why aren't elected officials also getting ticketed a silly number of times for silly infractions,"  I mean "Why aren't all the residents who don't like this system voting for people who promise to abolish these practices?"
We should put Hitler on Stars of David.
We need as many legitimate voters as we can get.
Calling them all "authoritarians" is a little judgmental. It might technically be correct since said liberals are in fact trying to change the behavior of others, but it has a bad connotation.
You mean the charities that would rather shut down entirely than to adopt children to loving gay families?
I think most abortion should be illegal. If the mother's life is in jeopardy, I see it as an act of self-defense, so I think it is justified in that case. I think it should be legal in cases of rape and incest too.  But just doing it for as a means of convenience or economic means, I don't think I could ever see a way that could be morally justified, which goes back to my last comment where I said we as a society have a duty to minimize abortions, minimize accidental pregnancies, and support those who do get pregnant and need support and their unborn children. In doing that, we could increase everyone's quality of life involved.
Thanks I rely on text to speech far too much!
Can I get "trigger" insurance as well?

Actually it's quite accurate.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement#Disputes_and_controversies
My issue is that he gave a poor, wishy-washy answer to the issue of Cannabis reform; and further that his wishy-washy answer does nothing to legitimize his position on "big banks" and other exorbitant, wasteful, and criminal aspects of modern government.  Without going into huge detail on it and complaining for hours, it seems very two-faced to me to not have a stance on the issue beyond a very lackluster statement about "waiting and seeing." If this is how he handles what, I feel, should be a cut-and-dry issue that his policies should already reflect? Then I can't have *faith* in him to do the right thing. I draw the parallel between his statement on Colorado and the Obama's stance on transparency because I feel they're the same campaign falsehood.  As for how it applies to the link above? This concept of the 1% trying to "depict him as an outlier" is bogus and just ends up as another news-oriented feedback loop. *Oh he's such an outlier, he has a number of stances on an obvious issue that MUST be addressed!* Heaven forbid the rest of his policies and statements back up those stances that make him a so-called outlier.
Well Sarah Silverman's just trying to make a living. 
how many fluff articles about Bernie Sanders are going to hit the front page
my bad, no emotes, but I fully agree that all presidents should be removed and replaced with the bill of rights, the 14th and 13th amendments and the Miranda Rights along with other laws pertaining to the restriction of state and federal government power.  In effort to educate those who don't know their rights.
The left: "Don't eat that its bad for you. Don't build that it will hurt the migrant ant population. Don't say that it will hurt someones feelings. Don't write that it will offend someone. Give me your money, this person needs it more because I think so."  It is easy to think you are right when you paint the other side with broad hyperbolic strokes.
Voting for Sanders in the primary can have no negative ramification.  Go do it.
If you sell alcohol at a bar you need insurance. If you manufacture drugs you need insurance, if you own a swimming pool at your home it requires additional insurance, if you drive a car you need insurance, if you fly a plane you need insurance,  the list goes on and on.
Pssh.... Any of them would have if the money behind their campaigns wanted it done.
&gt; only reason  Really? Hes polling at 16% or so.  By definition he is a fringe/outlier candidate.  And if you want "reasons" maybe look at his name recognition compared to the likes of Bush, Clinton, Paul.  Or maybe that quite a few of us like where his heart is at, but don't like the way in which he would implement things.  So far most of what i've read on the details shows he doesn't understand cause and effect.  That being said, if it came down to him vs clinton or a non libertarian leaning conservative, id vote for him.  
Conservatives hate the new pope because of his radical take on inequality and greed.
There were 31,000 accidents involving guns last year in the US.  People get hurt everyday.
Yeah. I hope that, at the least, he pulls the conversation to the Left in a noticeable and long term way.

But I made a snowball a couple weeks ago.   CHECKMATE, SCIENCE 
it is a shame when Libertarians get on the Political Correctness bus 
I find the attempts to "rebrand" the term prolife to pro-birth or anti-choice really infantile.  It serves no purpose to the actual debate and confuses already established terms.  
Correlation doesn't equal causation. This is a fundamental principle whenever you interpret data. 
I think its really sad that we claim very little to do with ISIS, but the moment Israel is threatened, watch how our government will jump through hoops to combat ISIS.  Its disgusting.
You want a law banning the 5th Amendment?
Let's award everyone without a degree a BA. That should reduce our healthcare costs, right? If that's too much, let's send everyone to study Shakespeare for a semester. That'll also reduce our healthcare costs, right? Because education.  Get it straight. College doesn't make inquisitive, self-actuated citizens who make good choices. It's the other way around. Intelligent people who care about investing in their future and the future of their community and nation go to college.  Re-reading this post, I sound bitter. But I don't like to see correlations blindly trumpeted as causative agents. Burden on society my ass. What's a burden on society are those who lack the ambition and drive to better themselves and their surroundings. The only thing holding back a dedicated student in the United States would be our society's weak social safety net and/or immigration status, and I would much prefer our limited federal revenue be spent on fixing that instead of paying even more money to 40k/year diploma mills. I see no problem with our current system of community colleges in providing affordable post-secondary education.
My vote is for Lincoln.  I think the penny should be axed altogether and his face should be transferred to a more powerful form of currency.  
Both the National Bureau of Economic Research and Pew Research Center are non-partisan organizations so I don't know why you would think they are right leaning.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center  Walter Block (the guy in the vid), is a pretty hardcore libertarian, but I don't see why that should matter. I linked his video, because it was a simple explanation that was to the point. I don't think it should be disregarded just because he might be "right leaning".  
&gt; Let people do what they want with their own bodies  Like not get vaccinated?   &gt;Stop discriminating against people and treat them as equals  Unless we determine we need to correct some privileges   Even though you haven't touched on real issues of financial heft and international politics and economic policy and domestic issues like firearms ownership and property rights that *vastly* distinguish the left and the right, you're already cherry picking what you've brought up. 
Although I don't agree Bernie is clueless about how the world works, I think it might be better to have a president who doesn't understand cause and effect than to have one who understands cause and effect and uses it to enrich themselves and their friends at the expense of the rest of the country.
What a dangerous *censored* Obama turned out to be. 
The irony of /politics calling out faux news and the "mindless right" chant repeating, when the same exact sheepleness lives, sleeps, and breathes here.
&gt;Nor do my statements deal in absolutes, but rather in tendencies that I've observed.  Pro-life and Pro-choice are not necessarily mutually exhaustive. Some people might not identify one way or another.
If you think that's what pro-life means, you are part of that 90%.
That way it's never wrong
Your arguing under the assumption that all government programs are beneficial, I disagree with that notion.  We already have too many college grads we don't need another government program (funded by the middle class of course) that tries to solve a problem we don't have.
Other way around.

Oh who fucking cares?
The timing of this event itself is highly suspect. Why right now of all times? We had the anthrax accident, we've got this muhammed cartoon contest and lone wolf warnings, and we get Hastert.  The Hastert indictment shows us that "Hey, we better have the NSA programs after all, because we need to know which of our politicians is being blackmailed." And the NSA needs to know this so that they themselves can blackmail them for being blackmailed, then actually indict them whenever they feel like it benefits their interests to do so.
I hope so,  don't have as much optimism as you but I hope so. B
Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither. -Iron Man  That suddenly has incredible biting meaning to this guy I bet.
Your house gets public utilities, that doesn't give the government the right to decide whom you meet with there.   Also, the government requires businesses to get those licenses, so it's not fair to then claim that because they do they need to follow even more rules. 
It won't be that expensive and it will add a greater level of responsibility and accountability. i would also argue that it would serve to protect law abiding, responsible gun owners from those who don't take gun ownership seriously by erecting a minor hurdle to ownership, finally in the rare event of an accident it would help compensate victims for the pain and suffering inflicted by an irresponsible gun owner. As for the constitutional argument I think we need to come to grips with the fact that our world has significantly changed since the era of cannon and musket, from a practical standpoint it makes little sense to religiously adhere to what most find to be a rather nebulous definition granting the right to bear arms. In the founder's day it would be rather difficult for a toddler to operate a flintlock rifle or manage the steps to load and fire a cannon, today it's as simple as squeezing a trigger so requiring insurance, which will be cheap, is a rather low bar to reach for most responsible gun owners.
But the real nightmare is the Tea Party nuts here think Kansas is doing awesome.
There is no comparison.  Give Tubman a commemorative coin or something, but leave the giants in place.  Our educational system today is already way too biased against the Founders and those that really shaped America in its earlier years.
No, it's not. You have no idea what you're talking about. (Scientific) socialism refers to the democratic control of the means of production (assuming you can bastardize its definition into one sentence).  Communism is a stateless, moneyless, and classless society that is to arise after socialism had been achieved and technology has turned society more or less post-scarcity.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_history
And if it's on private land rather than public it's not a fair comparison.
They sure aren't an expert if their analysis is completely wrong. 
Nobody is saying he is not.  But if you live in a civilized country, like America for example, you need to understand that the good life you enjoy is only because of people like Jackson who built this nation.  
It's because the down voters have only seen Austin. 
It's amazing how pro unions /r/politics is until it isn't. 
Google his many moments of plagiarism and to my knowledge he's never admitted any wrong-doing in any scenario. 
FDR's Congress was significantly more friendly towards progressive reform than our current Congress.  Hell, it was more friendly than the magical 9-month '10 supermajority Congress that got us PPACA, Dodd-Frank, student loan reform, and the stimulus.  It's not enough to have a progressive President.  You need a progressive legislature to match (and a progressive Judiciary doesn't hurt, either).

The insurance offered is to protect you from civil suits. If the person you shot's family sued you in civil court for damages. 
&gt;       &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Like not get vaccinated?   I hate when people bring this up as an argument against abortions. An abortion affects 1-3 people(depending on your views, the Mother, Child, and/or Father).   A single person not getting vaccinated can lead to dozens, if not hundreds of cases of potentially life threatening diseases. Measles and pertussis have had particularly bad years,  the number of confirmed cases for both of these diseases have reached levels we haven't seen since in a few decades.  So when you say not getting vaccinated should be a choice equivalent to abortion, you are taking the life and health of dozens to hundreds of people and comparing it to 1-3 people.
Bernie Sanders is too busy masturbating to his rape fantasies.
Yep, sounds like a lot.  However, Street Maintenance lawsuits costs 2x more than police misconduct  [Police misconduct: Los Angeles ~$101 million between 2002 and 2011.  $10M/Year](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/29/police-misconduct-settlements_n_7423386.html)   [Deferred maintenance of Los Angeles streets, sidewalks, sewer lines and water pipes cost taxpayers more than $22 million last year for injuries and property damage, records show.](http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/24/local/me-1227) 
Grant was a terrible and incompetent president though. Really we probably shouldn't be lionizing politicians at all, since their legacies are almost always tainted with distasteful compromise in the best of cases, and the slaveholder politicians from before the civil war were by and large a hypocritical lot at best and downright evil most of the time.   I'd much rather have a peace activist like Martin Luther King Jr, or a scientist such as Edwin Hubble. If we must have politicians, at least we should restrict ourselves to non-slaveholders, preferably after the civil war.
I'm simply saying the claim that Texas's refusal to expand medicaid is resulting in people not being able to receive treatment is false. Their lack of preventative care and high rate of uninsured is bad, but that has nothing to do with the fact that the above claim is false. I don't know why you're conflating the two. 
I completely agree, but I think it is important to simultaneously believe that Jackson is one of the greatest of all Americans *and* that he was utterly cruel to the native people in his drive to destroy them.  This helps people understand that the good fortunes of America did not come because Americans were a particularly virtuous people.
As a libertarian, just by skimming the article I agree. It's garbage.   Here's a much more reasonable argument against the minimum wage.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUnvHnSbLdI

I'm pro union until given a reason not to be.  Cops have given me reasons to be anti police union daily
With same resolve, social conservatives claim to defend the innocent lives of unborn babies
That is fair enough.  The right has perhaps co-opted "pro-life" into something that means no abortions for anyone.  It's totally OK for people to think it's "wrong"/not for them so long as they don't force that on others.
Ah, ok. I see the difference you were trying to point out. Mea culpa.   That's still a LOT of money for someone in my position. 
Prayers are the reason we have hot and cold weather. When it get hot people pray for cooler weather. Heaven gets so many they get behind so then they get through all the we want warmer weather from last winter and start on the we want cooler prayer requests.   People be careful how you pray for warmer or cooler weather.
Why no guns?
Hastert went to my high school in '61 and his plaque is in the front office.  I wonder if this could cause them to take down the plaque...
&gt; Historically speaking, we are always moving towards further social liberalism.  ftfy. For the developed countries, especially in Europe, they tend to move away from economic liberalism
Just like when they cut birth control funding a couple years back and were surprised to find out how many times more the increased low-income births would cost them, *just in immediate medical costs*, let alone the long term obligations...  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/us/likely-increase-in-births-has-some-lawmakers-revisiting-cuts.html
Yeah because the arguments for pro-life are fucking stupid and inconsistent as hell. They can't even actively define what a person is without having some kind of discrimination. Oh it's because it's a human. Well I guess if aliens came down they aren't people then.  Oh it's because it will be life eventually. So then it's not a person now making the whole conversation pointless.  Oh it's a sin. No you're a fucking sin shut the fuck up.  To be honest I hate the pro life mentality. It's a just a circular argument that has no real basis for itself.
I don't believe that they were added because of their support for those kinds of organizations, considering that the US government itself supported *far worse* organizations in the same regions (even in the same conflicts!).  The US added Cuba to that kind of list because it has done everything it can to undermine Cuba since the Cuban revolution.
Neither does carrying a gun in public, really.  The comparison of cars and guns would only make sense if we walked around in crowded cities shooting targets that were placed along sidewalks at chest-height. A gun that isn't being actively fired is no threat to anyone.
...and the number one reason why Bernie Sanders will not defeat Hillary in the primary can be boiled down to four little words.  - [Angry old white guy](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr05/2013/7/18/10/enhanced-buzz-21549-1374157836-4.jpg)  Thanks for playing everybody! 
Perhaps you are misreading my comment. I'm not here to support either party. I'm pointing out that "forcing 'moral values' on the nation" is not necessarily a bad thing. 
&gt; The difference is that cars aren't a constitutionally protected right, and the insurance requirements are only for public use.  Also, federal gun registries are *illegal*. Either Maloney has to break federal law to pass her bill, or there will be no federal way to track this, which means the law does nothing because nobody will comply with it except idiots.
I don't really believe this poll. Nearly every other poll has shown America becoming more conservative on abortion.  There is wide support for limiting abortion to 20 weeks.  I suspect the poll used odd word choice and does not accurately reflect reality. 
There was this fantastic article / study done by a historian that was on reddit recently and she went through all of American history and found this constant back and forth between the owner class extracting wealth from the bottom class for X amount of years and then it would go in the other direction where the progressives would claw back gains from the owner class.  It was fascinating to see how this back and forth was going on since the beginning.  I'm actually pretty angry I can't find it.  Driving me nuts.  You would love it.  Generations has a lot of that same flavor.
Correct me if I am wrong, but technically isn't a "state" another definition of "country"? Aka the "state" department??? Just use that definition and boom done
The automatic payment transaction tax at 0.7% would decrease the tax burden of almost every individual, excepting those who use the same money multiple times (stock trades) and corporations.  It replaces the tax code, including credits, eliminating need for a large IRS. It treats transactions equally and thus your tax is proportional to the utility you derive from the economy.
How about, "don't tell me what myself and my employee are able to agree to for a wage or benefits".  Or "don't confiscate an ever growing portion of my paycheck to pay for programs that you happen to feel are morally good".
That's a good question, and I don't profess to have the answer.  However, let's make a parallel hypothetical:  Your best friend is having an affair.  He spurns his mistress, and she demands $10k or she will tell his wife.  He doesn't have $10k, and comes to you.  You agree to help him out, so you withdraw $5000 one day and $5000 the next to avoid IRS reporting.  Something goes wrong somewhere in the deal and suddenly a cop is asking what you did with the money.  You tell him you gave it to your friend when in fact you paid it to the mistress.  Boom! Federal crime.  I get that this is far from an exact parallel, but it results in the same charges.  The Hastert case is definitely an example of Patriot Act laws being used for purposes outside the boundaries of their intentions, the irony of which is certainly not lost on me.  
Homeowners' insurance covers swimming pools.  Malpractice and health insurance cover the medical drugs issue.  "Alcohol" is too vague to understand what you really mean, but let's just assume you are wrong about that too.

Not all of them want abstinence only education and are anti-birth control, but there is a lot of overlap
My problem with the speaking fees and foundations is that it's a backdoor bribe in a lot of ways.  You can setup a foundation and pay yourself and family members millions out of donations. Non profit abuse is a global issue.
Plenty of non criminals accidentally kill people. No different than a car. If you fuck up in a car, it can kill someone, so you have to have insurance. I don't see whats different when its a gun.

&gt; 1) the ban was only on the transportation of MMT, not the sale  You've misquoted me. I said it was a ban on the importation (and transport), which it was.   &gt; 2) the ban was repealed because MMT isn't harmful, not because of the lawsuit.  *"... an NAFTA lawsuit caused Canada to overturn its ban on MMT, a fuel additive that was blamed for neurological maladies. The ban was challenged by the Richmond, Va.-based Ethyl Corp. because it "expropriated" future profits and damaged Ethyl's "good reputation."*  [SF Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Canadian-Firm-Sues-California-Over-MTBE-970-2923389.php)  The EPA also finds that [*"a reasonable basis exists for concern regarding potential public health risks.."*](http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158525) of MMT which is why it denied Ethyl Corp a waiver for the use of the additive.  &gt;3) the ban was a backdoor trade barrier because it prohibited inter-province transportation and would require Ethyl to have a factory in each province to sell it there.  Canadian legislators wanted to ban the use of MMT in order to protect the Canadian public. Because they could not do so under Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) provisions, they chose the best available alternative: banning MMT's import and transport. 
yes, lets not make any more laws at all because criminals never seem to follow them anyway. why bother right?
&gt;You can do a straight inflation comparison because the US changed so much since then.  Well yeah... and much that *because* of the purchase.   Wound up being a pretty solid investment. 
Most people who self identify as pro-life, are also in favor of keeping the death penalty in active use, are against contraceptive use of any kind, and want to reduce or end state support for the poor (who are mostly children.)

How do you know who they voted for?   Let's stop the hyperbole. 
Tell me, has lack of insurance - or even lack of a license and proper registration - ever actually stopped someone from driving a car if they really wanted to drive it?
You're reading waaaay too much into what I said.  Calm down.
Maybe something will be done about it now that its happening to white people.  :(
Only a fucking moron could possibly believe that this law is going to stop a single criminal act, ever. You might as well pass a law making it illegal to put TruckNuts on your tow hitch because you think it will reduce road rage.
Not unless you're using the bastardised American definition of liberal. The original definition basically means capitalist. Which is a category both republicans and democrats fall into, but not socialists or feudalists.  So maybe you should consider learning what words mean before calling people morons.
The Republicans would love if Sanders somehow won the Democratic primary because it would all but guarantee them the presidency. 
Your position is just as much an appeal to rhetoric as "pro-life" is.  
Sounds like a savings problem.
Every day a liberal is born, every day a liberal becomes a conservative  and every day a conservative dies. such is the circle of life.
Perhaps there should of been a little more time to read the bill before it was passed to catch problems just like this from ending up in the final passage. The law as written does say subsidies are only available to those who purchase on state exchanges. The articles argument that that information didn't appear in another section so it's meaningless is alitll poor in my opinion. Also it seems to suggest because the bill is a thousand pages that these little errors don't matter and we should gloss over them is ridiculous. The bill was written and passed in this form so we have to take it as the law  
Here's another study:  http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/BakijaColeHeimJobsIncomeGrowthTopEarners.pdf  "We find that executives, managers, supervisors, and financial professionals account for about 60 percent of the top 0.1 percent of income earners in recent years, and can account for 70 percent of the increase in the share of national income going to the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution between 1979 and 2005. During 1979-2005 there was substantial heterogeneity in growth rates of income for top earners across occupations, and significant divergence in incomes within occupations among people in the top 1 percent. "
It was free almost everywhere that required it.  &gt;and voting rights are infinity more important.  I'm sure if all the victims of street crime weren't too busy being dead, they'd agree.
He molested a student.
No, you just flipped the assumption around. You originally claimed that an additional tax would go to corruption, not beneficial causes. You didn't cite any sources or give any justification for this claim.  I said you had changed the subject (which you did) and didn't give any justification for the claim (which you had not).  You are now arguing about whether additional taxes, in general, are a good idea.  You seem to be arguing that they are not a good idea because money goes to corruption rather than benefiting people.   This is a pretty big claim, because some programs clearly benefit people (e.g. medicare) and many programs have very little waste (e.g. Social Security, which spends just 1.3% of its funding on administration). Moreover, you haven't provided any support behind your claim, so it is not very strong.    To defeat your claim, I don't have to argue that ALL government programs are beneficial - I just have to show that on-balance, additional taxes would be more beneficial than they would be detrimental. This is complicated, because the effect of taxes on the economy is a matter of substantial debate; however, you make it easier because your argument isn't very good in the first place - you are just arguing that government is corrupt and additional programs will not benefit anyone. This argument is probably irrelevant, as additional taxes would go towards balancing the federal budget, not towards new programs - taxes and spending under our current system are very loosely tied.  The part about college grads and solving "a problem we don't have" is totally irrelevant to your argument.   And as an aside, I think it is a little weird that you are decrying the number of college grads while making a series of bad arguments and logical fallacies. Hopefully basic logic would be exactly the kind of thing that college grads would be learning...
Is the insurance magically going to make him un-shot?
Yeah but the liberal stuff you mentioned actually has real demonstrable effects on other people. The Christian stuff doesn't. Things like abortion, gay marriage etc have almost zero impact on other people's lives 
Really? Is there a little slot I have to put my insurance card in to start my car?   No there isn't. I drove without insurance for like nine months accidentally and, surprise, my car started every single time I pushed the button to start it.  Go read your local police blotter. People are pulled over for bullshit all the time and arrested / cited for having no insurance or suspended licenses. There are THOUSANDS of people on the road near you who have no insurance or licenses.   Absolutely nothing about the insurance / license requirement actually stops you from driving all you want, it only matters when a cop asks to see it. Just like this stupid law isn't going to matter to the real criminal threat either. The overwhelming majority of gun crime is committed by people who aren't legally allowed to own guns anyway. You think they're going to line up to insure their guns? That would actually be a violation of the [fifth amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haynes_v._United_States). This law literally does not even *apply* to criminals *by legal SCOTUS precedent.*  I'm sure when some old man with his over-under shotgun who's out hunting ducks, who's never heard of this law, gets thrown in prison, you're going to be there defending him and complaining about how he's a non-violent criminal and shouldn't be in jail over a stupid law.   I'm sure you will. Totally.
Nah, I'd like to think that most people are smarter than r/politics. 
So why do I have to carry insurance then? If I want to be protected from civil suits I'll take out my own insurance policy. If I don't care, I won't. Why does the law need to mandate it? 
You can't be a socialist if you live in the states.  You have socialist beliefs.  I think I'm a fucking god, doesn't actually make me one.
[THAT'S MY POINT.](http://goingconcern.com/sites/default/files/post/you%20don%27t%20say.jpg)
&gt; the government has shown time and time again that they will bail out the failures,    Which times other than 2007? 
Wait you are saying all Republicans want nuclear Holocaust, and see psychopaths. 
That's interesting, I guess I was assuming practically all christian faiths taught against alcohol. Besides the wine in church bit which only the Catholics believe in. 
I’ve met plenty of Pro-Life atheists on here.
Are you claiming Paul's newsletters were taken out of context by his fellow Republicans during the last presidential primaries?
I think it's because they think it's murder not because of anti-sex.  Though many of the religious groups support pro-life do also push abstinence. It's only a correlation they aren't builds off one another.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to say that the religious or those that support pro-life want to punish someone for having sex by making them raise their kids. 
Semantics.  Were talking about semantics.  Neither of us will convince the other.  The main point was that the OP thinks its the media alone.  Publicity helps but the media is not why a lot of us consider him "fringe/outlier."  i was all for Ron Paul.  And i considered him "fringe/outlier."  Accept it for what it is.  The real story is that /politics lives in its own bubble and thinks that because they upvote X it MUST be people with everyone in the US.  Far from it...
No, I believe what the poster was saying was that Republicans see abortion as this horrific loss of life, something truly despicable, and then they go and vote down environmental legislation that would save MANY lives.
This logic completely baffles me because if you insert any terrible thing in, you'd seem looney to do it.   "I personally think that giving heroin to infants is wrong but I wouldn't force other parents to not do that because it's their choice what to do with their child"
*by accident
&gt;Don't say that it will hurt someone's feelings. Don't write that it will offend someone.    This sounds more like the right then the left. The social conservative / evangelical right is always offended about somebody insulting them in some way.  The fiscally conservative right is always pushing for increased restrictions on food stamp and wic programs. They want to ensure that only the foods they approve of can be purchased.   As far as wanting your money, it [really doesn't matter if the right or left is in power, both sides are going to take it](http://i.imgur.com/aGtuwwV.png). The only real difference is how you prefer public wealth to be used.

Um, no , funds for Medicaid were not taken away. Funds to help hospitals pay the costs of treating the uninsured were. Medicaid expansion is part of Obamacare. The federal government is paying for at least 90% of Medicaid costs. Allowing people to simply remain uninsured costs the state of Texas big money.
&gt; The original definition  Because it's still the 1800s, right? I'd say "Cool story, bro," but it might confuse you since the story doesn't have a low temperature, and you aren't my male sibling. Oh, and:  &gt; The original definition basically means capitalist  No it doesn't. The original definition means "generous" and dates back to the 1300s.
Not all socialists are Marxist. See anarchists (the real ones, not the ultra-capitalists that pretend to be anarchists).
Wow, I've tried to make this same point in other abortion threads, but no one else ever seems to get it. The idea that something magical and special occurs the instant you combine sperm A + egg B is just incomprehensible to me. There's so many possible combinations that it's really no big deal if you cancel this one and try a different combination later.   On top of that, no one seems to be outraged about the 50%+ of fertilized eggs that naturally don't stick. If someone cares that much about fertilized eggs and embryos, abortion is really a drop in the bucket compared to what nature dishes out. Feeling morally obliged to commit one's body to growing the random one that happened to stick is silly, and it's worse when people feel like they have the right to tell someone else to make that commitment and take all those health risks for a random sperm+egg. 
Like the old joke goes, The only thing that could have brought him down was being caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.

First of all "brown people"? Like really? You would think if your country was so educated and wise you would know they are called Mexican, Guatemalan, ect... and if i remember  correctly the U.S. has one of, if no the best technology in the world and we dont use socialism. Its nice to sit on an island with the central goverment in Copenhagen telling you taxes are great, but in a larger country (also a super power and number 1 in military status) things run diffrently, plus the U.S. is a lot more racally diverse. So while its nice to have NATO backing you, (because you cant afford your own military that would be any larger than 10,000 people) the U.S. is always used as the world police while all the other countries (like Demark) sit back and relax while judging. Looks like the socialist education does not always proove as useful as you would think in the real world.
http://misleddit.com/p/2gyf1g/  edit: not all fetuses should be carried to term.
I like you and you seem to understand what we deal with here in NH.  Try getting a pro union message published in the Union Leader. I have a better chance winning the lottery, twice. 
The current floods are actually more due to overbuilding which causes huge amounts of runoff.   The amount of rain is not causing the flooding in that if the area was less built on like it was 20 years ago, this amount of rain would have barely put a dent in the area.   But please feel free to constantly blame every ill in this country on 'publicans and global warmi.... err I mean climate change. 
Wrong about what? Thinking that knowingly misleading people is morally reprehensible when doing it for a reward and childish for karma? That's about where I stand.
I will.  So your argument is void.  My adopted nieces argue with me on this point as well.  Since their mom was convinced to carry them to term then let them be adopted by other pro lifers my brother and wife...twice(same parents took both).   But you know go with your gross generalizing. ..but might I also add there are organizations that do just this. ..

I think he pretty much just expanded your comment, it's not a good argument.
No, let's not. 
Anyone born in the US is a US citizen per the Constitution so deporting a US citizen to any place outside the US is unconstitutional and amounts to a type of extraordinary rendition.   And yeah, gotta love those bill names that whitewash what the bill actually does. 
- "always".
"in the rare event of an accident"?  That's already covered by the liability portion of your homeowners policy. But yes, let's add more taxes, more economic burden on people by mandating more. Let's make people buy liability insurance to eat fast food; to cover the pain and suffering, should a vegan witness it.    
Doesnt a deal have to constitute a gain for all parties?
Are you arguing that the fact that Americans are armed to the teeth has nothing to do with our higher level of fatalities in police interactions? Because that's obviously wrong.
[The Littlest Dictator](http://i.imgur.com/pn6oZxb.jpg)   
Why did you put the word  life in quotations? Do you really believe that a developing fetus is not life? 
Could have to do with people's ability to transport things from one place to another on roads.
The man has the right to say whatever he wants.  He even has the right not to address topics he previously spoke or wrote upon.  The voters, on the other hand, should have ready access via the press about everything a candidate has said or written, and to demand an explanation by the candidate when some of his words raise important questions about his beliefs (and possible actions?).  I'm not saying Bernie Sanders raped and murdered an 11 year old girl when he was in college, but why won't Bernie Sanders answer questions about how and when he raped and killed an 11 year old girl? /s
&gt;Immigrants Vote for Democrats because Republicans Don't Want to Give Them the Right to Vote
fuck off with the slave guilt   This man was a hero 
We deny felons the right to vote based on criminal actions. Isn't being here illegally, you know, illegal?
Probably up until the primaries.  If he is allowed to debate then we will get all the posts about how he won the debate and how awesome he is.  When Hillary wins the primary it will switch over to how Hillary is not that bad and most of the upvoted content will be about her or how whatever Republican is the next antichrist.

So one Democrat is the reason why no Democrats are reasonable?  You sound like a level person.  
[Commerce Clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause), gun rights are not being infringed, contrary to the popular opinion here.  Liability insurance mandates, have been proven to be something the federal government is allowed to do.
Also, are gun fatalities actually rising?  I know homicide rates have been dropping.  Is there some increase in accidents and suicides making up the difference?
&gt;.."Why aren't all the residents who don't like this system voting for people who promise to abolish these practices?"  Because the groups they harass are in the minority.   Nevermind...  &gt;Pagedale, incidentally, is 93 percent black. Nearly a quarter of its residents live below the poverty line.
Were there any white landowners at the time who *didn't* have slaves? 
I think that makes up for less than 1% of the bad he did.
Both laws are overstepping.   You should be able to do whatever the fuck with your property as long as it doesn't damage someone else's.
Certainly.  However Bernie isnt being left out.
Huh guess I should frequent news sub, I've yet to see this on the front page
If only this country could attract dumbass old white people from other countries to move here.
Except the average guy isn't going to have the millions for care necessary to recover from such an accident. They would sooner go bankrupt than be able to finance the recovery.
Antisex? So nothing to do with killing an unborn child?
That could've been the subtitle of his rape fantasy essay.
Scary that this little essay flies over so many heads.
Is there a problem with what was said or do you always attack grammar instead of substance?
people are surprised at an honest politician but that doesn't mean people want politicians to be liars.
It doesn't seem like the purpose of the bill is to deter crime.

So we should be shady and use terms like "most" while we're making shit up?
Nobody is talking about this part.  What cold he have done to *earn* this much money?  What kind of "influence" did he have to sell, and to whom?
So your answer is yes?
In addition, the insurance company would have a higher motivation to reduce payouts by fighting harder than the city since it IS their money, and to the city, it is just taxpayer money...
No.
With the disclose (confirmed?) that this was gay pedophilia am I the only one that thinks this guy should be on a suicide watch.
Many people don't get insurance because they don't think they need it, only to need it and not have it. We have mandatory car insurance, we have mandatory health insurance.   I'm not arguing this from a "stop the criminals" perspective, mandatory insurance becomes real cheap, especially for incredibly rare things. The premiums will be minuscule.  Gun accidents result in expensive hospital stays, stays that cost more than even the net worth of the person who committed the accident. Insurance alleviates that.
I don't think they know what their point is.  
Commerce clause has to do with commerce...how does that include insurance?
There are plenty of people who drive without insurance, yes. There are also plenty of people who would never drive without it because the potential fallout of not having it is so high. The low end is having to pay $500 out of pocket for a fender-bender. The high end is getting slapped with a massive judgment for a negligence or wrongful death suit that, because you don't have insurance (unless you're rich), follows you for life.  You made the decision to drive without insurance and apparently you didn't worry about getting stuck with a massive tort judgment entered against you. Good for you. I'd also suggest that's pretty fucking selfish on your end because if you ever had an at fault accident and seriously hurt someone, unless you're very wealthy, that person would never get compensated for their medical expenses and lost income. But that's an entirely different topic.  But there are countless people who understand the dangers of driving without insurance and wouldn't do it. Particularly in those states where not having auto insurance is illegal.  Furthermore, Haynes v. United States is completely inapplicable here. The law in question required people to register their firearms and it ended up being a self-incrimination clause violation because it required convicted felons to register their weapons. You can't register a firearm before you have it. Because convicted felons can't own firearms, it was effectively forcing them to implicate themselves in unlawfully owning a gun.  That is absolutely not what this law does and has nothing in common. It would require you to have liability insurance before you could purchase a gun. Even if you were a convicted felon, buying liability insurance from a private company doesn't implicate you in anything except owning liability insurance. And even if that were somehow an issue, the law could easily be amended to only require lawful gun owners to get liability insurance.  Because as someone pointed out, this isn't a crime prevention issue. It's an issue of encouraging people who have guns lawfully to be safe with them. We want to encourage people to be safe with their weapons and we want people who are injured or killed by accidents to have access to the compensation that's going to make them whole.

The point of insurance is to pay for the damage when shit inevitably happens. I really don't get why you think insurance's purpose is to keep people without it from driving. I'm not seeing the link. Insurance for gun owners isn't designed to keep people from using guns when they shouldn't, its to pay for the inevitable fuck up that accidentally shoots someone, like what happened to brad. Get over your "they're taking our guns!" Narrative and use your brain for a second. You will be doing yourself and everyone else a favor.
Yea and you know that there are other ways to talk about stereotypes that does call you a loser or women losers or refers to gang bang, rape or bondage.  If that is all he can do then he is not very smart now.  Also why does this exist then if it is suppose to be academic?  http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/bernie-sanders-rape-essay-1972/  Got a answer lemming?   
I thought his point was that laws banning untrained civilians from owning heavy machine guns and RPGs is unconstitutional?  
&gt; go to great lengths to pass legislation that would increase the numbers of abortions and unplanned pregnancies.  Yes.  Their policies result in *more* killings of "unborn children" as you have phrased it.  So it's clearly not about preventing the killing of "unborn children".
I heard atheist families regularly sneak into your windows at night and drain the blood from newborns of Christians for Carl Sagan rituals.  Not a small part of the reason is because they feel they are "sticking it to" the Big Man upstairs.
Involving insurance could actually make things worse.  It would open a floodgate of tort lawsuits because insurance companies have deep pockets.
 If i told you once, I told you a million times. No I don't.

It is potential life.  If you want to be pedantic about definitions it is potential human life because the mold growing on old bread is technically life as is the fungus on your toes.  Everybody has squishy point on the issue, about how developed the fetus is, including myself, but in this particular debate on the value of potential life vs. actual living people I have no doubt. 
He did become a lobbyist after his House Speakership was up.
Personally I would still allow for abortions. Men kill millions of potential babies every time they masturbate. I fail to see how abortion is any different.
Kansas, home state of Koch Industries.
&gt;What's the difference?  I don't drive my gun to work, and I don't know anyone who does.   You don't carry insurance because you drive to work, you carry it because you could damage someone else or their property wrongfully, just as one can with a gun.   &gt;Most states don't even allow you to carry a gun in public.   And?  &gt;Let's make parents get liability insurance for every child. Who's more irresponsible than a child? And if Johnny is a little league baseball pitcher, what if he beans a batter, because his parents weren't responsible enough to teach him proper control?     The league usually carries injury insurance AND typically has you sign an agreement not to sue people for injuries incurred as a normal part of the sport.   &gt;They should pay for the pain and suffering of the child who he hit, right?  Man, when I played, I could have gotten monetary compensation, rather than just being awarded first base.   Are you being intentionally dishonest in this comparison or do you honestly think getting hit with a baseball is the equivalent of being shot?  
Ask a thousand people if they feel stealing is immoral and wrong. Then ask the same people if they feel a fertilized egg, embryo or early stage fetus is actually a human being. Compare your results.   Don't play dense. Everybody knows stealing is morally and ethically wrong and unacceptable in a civilized society, nobody disagrees on that. Abortion, not so much.
Don't we we already have mandated health insurance for every person in the country?
The problem is the media making everything worse
Person A shoots Person B on accident. Person B goes to hospital, Person B goes to civil court to sue Person A for damages. Only gets 10,000, his own health insurance has to pay the rest.   His health insurance pool is across many states, therefore it is interstate commerce.  &gt;It is true, as we have stressed, that driving an automobile is not a constitutional right, whereas owning a firearm is. There is, however, no general constitutional rule that citizens must be exempted from the obligation to internalize the costs of exercising their constitutional rights. High-quality firearms are expensive, but that does not mean that government must subsidize their purchase by impecunious individuals. Access to shooting ranges is protected by the Second Amendment,36 but this does not imply that range owners have a constitutional right to operate without liability insurance. **To the extent that a liability policy prevents gun owners from externalizing the risk of their own negligence onto innocent victims or society at large, it is analogous to a government regulation that requires newspaper companies to carry workers’ compensation insurance.** That said, any mandatory insurance statute should be closely scrutinized for features that would encourage insurers to overcharge the very people to whom Second Amendment rights are most valuable.  [This article has a pretty unbiased view of the whole idea of mandatory gun insurance.](http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/mandatory-liability-insurance-for-firearm-owners-design-choices-and-second-amendment-limits)
Here's a hypothetical. Jim Bob's son, Billy Bob, goes over to his friend Bubba's house. Bubba's father, Burt, is on works only part time, so he's got enough to subsist on, but he doesn't have any real savings to speak of. Burt owns a gun.  While at Bubba's house, Bubba wants to show off his father's gun to Billy Bob and accidentally shoots Billy Bob. Billy Bob is now paralyzed for life. Billy Bob's family is very poor and cannot afford the massive medical bills that result from his injuries and now, for the remainder of his life, Billy Bob becomes a burden on his family because he cannot work and his family must also end up working less because someone always has to be caring for him. There's no reason for Billy Bob to sue Burt for negligence because Burt has no money.  Now, if you add one fact to that hypothetical- that Burt has gun insurance, Billy Bob's family can sue and be compensated to some degree. Which is the whole point of our tort system. If you're injured and it's someone else's fault, the injured person shouldn't be the one who has to suffer the monetary consequences. And even more ideally, the liable party doesn't suffer all the consequences either and end up bankrupt. You have insurance. Insurance pays out and insurance rates for everyone go up a tiny bit so that in effect, society is bearing the burden in little tiny pieces and no single party ends up destitute.  I've given you a pretty extreme example. But the number of people in this country who could not afford catastrophic, or even moderately serious medical bills, even with insurance, is very high. Just like car accidents, the financial fallout for any sort of gun accident has the potential to be massive without insurance.  It's not just about stopping accidents, though it would function on the same principle as car insurance. If you're safe, your rates can get better. If you're a fuck up, your rates are getting jacked up. So people have an incentive not to do idiot things. But it's just as much about making sure that people can be compensated for loss. The principle is- if you're going to own something as dangerous as a gun, something that even in a completely innocent accident, can kill someone in an instant (like a car), you need to be able to deal with the fallout.
Hum, now there are more than one bringing up unfortunate facts about this "sucker's" history!  
Its the principal that matters.  Not the results.  ;)
It's not racist at all, but I'd be willing to discuss the issue if the right confessed they actually intended voter supression using the voter id laws you appear to be trying to reference 
&gt; Increased car safety standards and better technology; the confounding is laughable.  And the NRA and Republicans do everything possible to stop guns from becoming safer, such as requiring trigger locks and gun safes.
&gt;It is nevertheless difficult to argue that the Second Amendment flatly forbids such practices. It is true, as we have stressed, that driving an automobile is not a constitutional right, whereas owning a firearm is. There is, however, no general constitutional rule that citizens must be exempted from the obligation to internalize the costs of exercising their constitutional rights. High-quality firearms are expensive, but that does not mean that government must subsidize their purchase by impecunious individuals. Access to shooting ranges is protected by the Second Amendment,36 but this does not imply that range owners have a constitutional right to operate without liability insurance. **To the extent that a liability policy prevents gun owners from externalizing the risk of their own negligence onto innocent victims or society at large, it is analogous to a government regulation that requires newspaper companies to carry workers’ compensation insurance.** That said, any mandatory insurance statute should be closely scrutinized for features that would encourage insurers to overcharge the very people to whom Second Amendment rights are most valuable.

He couldn't as a pragmatic issue. That takes reason and thought and witnessing reality to realize that.  I realize you want the world to be as simplistic and immature as you are, but that's not reality.  Now go out and play.
No, the health insurance company is then responsible for the negligence of the shooter.
That's odd. Most atheists, not anti-theists, and agnostics that I have met or read the works of seem like pretty rational and well-balanced realists. Strange that they would sneak in your windows and drain the blood of newborns, but hey, you're the expert here.
You're right we do, however right now gun owners externalize their risks onto health insurance companies in the cases of their own negligence. Note, I'm talking about unintentional shootings, not criminal.
I would be praising the younger version of the republican and bitching at the older version. It's an interesting essay about gender roles in the "free love" and feminist movement.   It's uninteresting and irrelevant that Sanders wrote it. He's been preaching against the establishment his whole life. If someone like John Boehner wrote it then it would be immensely interesting, because the younger version of him was more intellectually critical than the current neocon policy of "one man one women, sex must be boring and only for conception". 
This is bullshit.  Whether you classify the death of an egg as a miscarriage has nothing to do with whether it is a new life.  This is barely even a scientific question.  (I wouldn't say it is at all really).  It's all a matter of how you define the terms.  Is it conscious?  Does it have unique genetics?  Can it survive outside of the mother?  Those are all scientific questions.  When does life begin is a philosophical question.    Personally, conception makes the most sense to me.  You could say when consciousness is gained, but lower life forms (bacteria for example) don't need to be conscious in order to be living.  So that seems a rather poor place to define the beginning of life.  You could say birth.  But since the fetus can clearly survive without the mother at some point before birth, that seems a poor definition.  You could say the point at which the fetus could survive without the mother, but that is a nebulous point.  There is going to be a period where the probability of surviving is going to be infinitesimally small then rise over time.    Anyway, if the "science" doesn't support life at conception, please tell me what it does say.
We had private police forces in the 1800s.  They were quickly "bought" by large corporations.  Look at the Pinkertons.
Thanks Carolyn..just a shout out thanking you for driving out "middle of the road folks/outdoor sportsman" from the democratic party!!  GREAT JOB IDIOT..........
He's not the president of the United States now and he's still not going to be after November 2016.  You can support his election campaign all you want.  I do too.  That doesn't mean he's president of anything until the votes are counted.  What wins elections is more people agreeing with us and voting for him than vote for his competitors, which is realistically not going to happen.
Miscarriages are not on purpose. 
What sections to be exact? Truthful I haven't read the whole law because it's huge but if you could point me to the section is be really interested in reading them 
How he plans on going about those things aren't.
But like the west wing, it is only fiction. 
&gt; The essay wasn't on rape.  There's no need for excuses. Even if it was about rape, the left would still  excuse  it.
The entire objective of the CBO is to be non-partisan.   Just because facts tend to lean democratic...  How about Politifact?  Crap - they heavily believe the CBO too.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/barack-obama/obama-health-care-driving-down-deficit/  &gt;&gt;&gt;The poor can get much better care than medicaid provides, that would be affordable, if we did it right.  Crippling debt from medical expenses, people losing their homes due to medical debt, bankruptcy, debtors prisons - we have that now.      Medicare has  1% - 3% overhead while private insurance is 17% or higher.    Overhead costs for ACA are higher - because it is only half a plan, it was all that could get passed.  And so sick of the more "Bootstraps! Don't coddle the poor, more stick less carrot!  Burn the witch!" drivel...  Bringing everyone to a sub-par level - again "I got mine! hurr de durr!"   Provide proof that everyone's standard of care is going down because of the ACA.  
&gt; It doesn't kill a fetus, it prevents conception from ever happening.  Abortion doesn't kill a baby, it prevents birth from ever happening.
I don't want to offend anyone but here is my opinion. It's pretty easy to define the difference between a miscarriage and a death by car accident. A death of a teenager is harder to cope with. The person has time to develop a personality and obviously knows more people than an unborn child. Losing a child to a miscarriage can be devistating to the mother, father and immediate family. 
Then I suppose you do know what marginal taxation is and therefore that you are misleading at best by saying 90% of income. It's not really a matter that relies upon your agreement, so try something else.
Kinda like Nixon and the Environmental movement...
I doubt someone under eighteen has the capability to blackmail someone for $3.5 million. 
The replacement jobs are low paying service jobs.    Prices on non essential goods are lower, but even that isn't really true, because the cheap stuff has to be replaced more often.  America has become a service economy,  do you not believe that? If you don't believe even that, then there is nothing I can show you or say to you to convince you.  Over the past 30 years, factory workers have watched as their jobs were sent overseas, sometimes they even trained their replacement workers.  Factory equipment was shipped to China and Mexico and many other low wage countries.    A book called "Factory Man"  talks about the off shoring of the furniture industry.  You might want to read it, but you kind of seem like you have made up your mind without looking at all (or any) of the info available.  You have to look at all the indicators.  Homelessness is way up. The cost of housing and utilities is up.  Way up.  Government subsidies to poor and low wage workers are also up.  Low prices on cheap imports do not make up for any of this.     
LePage brings a ray of light in the long dark winters here in northern Maine 
Excluding the fact that he is my personal favorite President, then should keep him simply because he was the only President that successfully reduced the US deficit to $0.
No one said Jefferson raped his slave. It was consensual.

Sanders is not a contender. 
I glanced at this waiting for the gif to start and one of the 2  standing buildings to fall.    My nephew looks at it and says "one of the buildings is sleeping."
You discredit yourself by thinking Sanders is a legitimate threat to Hillary.
They can't afford the gas money, or a car that will actually get them out of state without falling apart.
Basically, this is bringing up the idea of a mandated liability insurance for everything possible. Not too sure of the merits of such a thing, but it may be worth exploring.
Because they were all Christy.
Which socialist theorists are you citing specifically? DeJacque? Bakunin? Gramsci? Debord? Marx?
&gt;you consent to pregnancy the moment you have sex  I find it hard to see that statement as anything but ignorant ridiculousness.
&gt; Hundreds of dollars a year for your right to own a weapon?  By chance do you support subsidizing weapons for Americans who cannot afford them? Something akin to Food Stamps, i.e. Gun Stamps.
How many accidental killings were caused by all four of those combined last year? Don't be obtuse.

Here's the real reason:  The GOP is two separate parties in all but name and primaries.  But the social conservatives have taken the reins, and are pushing their candidates - Santorum, Huckabee, Cruz.  The establishmentarians are stuck trying to push their own centrist candidates - Jeb Bush being the strongest.  But this competition weakens each potential candidate because they must necessarily split the electorate.  The establishment doesn't have the party majority, so the portion that Jeb gets is not half.  The Tea Party candidates are vying for the largest piece of the pie, but there are so many who have declared that each is getting a small portion of a big piece.  So here we are.  The GOP hasn't settled on a candidate because they can't.  There will be a nominee, and he will have to tack to the right to win the Tea Party voters who control the primaries.  And this will disqualify him for the vast majority of the voters nationwide.  He'll win the Reliable South, and probably some Mountain states.  He'll get Arizona and Kansas and probably Missouri, barring a ridiculous gaff.  He'll get about 180-210 electoral votes, leaving the Democratic nominee with the remaning 300-360 votes.  And the country will continue its schism.  The only thing that can save this country, honestly, is a breakup of the Tea Party and the GOP.  This will force the establishment GOP to move to the center to serve as a legitimate dealmaker between the left-swinging Democrats (who are attracting more and more voters as the public swings to the left) and the rabidly-anti-government Tea Party.  They'll have a shot in southern districts and moderate districts, but will undoubtedly end up in a minority position.  But here's the thing: breaking up the GOP would actually make the establishment candidates MORE powerful.  By becoming a legitimate third party in a system without a majority party (assuming the Dems don't retake either house).  It would enable them to say, "Look, Democrats, you can do stuff, but only if you work with us.  Those whackobirds on the far right will obstruct you every step of the way.  But if you want to get something done....well, you know where we are."  It would be good for the Old Guard GOP and the country as a whole.  But back to the point at hand: Until they can do that, and see that, well....they won't be able to settle on any nominees, and they won't be able to get anything done.  And they will never win a national election until they do.
I really feel like if Paul got into office, he'd go right back to the conservative way. It seems like a front to me to try to take votes from the Democratic party after seeing a decent backing of Sanders. I could be really wrong and completely cynical though, especially since I'm not all that familiar with Rand's voting record in congress(and I know he's been for some good things before), but I'd rather have someone that has a hell of a track record of working for the average citizen than someone who seems to really hit it all of a sudden.
Yeah kinda but if you factored out Baltimore it wouldn't be and that's always on the menu.
I agree, this is why we should institute a program similar to Food Stamps, i.e. Gun Stamps. For far too long the poor of this nation have been financially limited in affording a weapon.   That is why every American in poverty should be entitled to Gun Stamps to help purchase their first weapon and keep a constant supply of ammunition.
We have no choice captain, we are going to have to go in over his head. 
If the topic of socialism is brought up, and someone immediately starts using Karl Marx terminology, that person doesn't understand the actual concepts of socialism.   They're just repeating what their middle-school civics teacher told them.
Really? This sounds interesting, tell me more.
&gt;With a number of potentially ~~appealing~~ appalling candidates in the race  In the latest Quinnaplac poll of old people who have nothing better to do than watch Fox and take computer polls, there were five (5) Republican contenders tied at 10%. Fox listed them appropriately in alphabetical order, but omitted Rand Paul at 7%. Murdoch must not like Paul. Three of those are religious right nuts.   Sound familiar? The important auditions were week before last, the first of three meetings of the religious right leaders who influence (more or less) roughly half of Republican voters.   In 2012 they only had one "secret" meeting, at their revered leader Paul Pressler's ranch in Texas. After acrimonious debate, with accusations of ballot box stuffing and other skullduggery, they chose Santorum (known as "frothy").   The religious right lunatics will eliminate each other. Jeb, or maybe Rubio, will get the nomination.   Check out the London bookie's sites. They picked Romney to win the nomination and Obama to win the election. 
&gt; does that mean Nike and Microsoft's "low wage" workers in china aren't really low wage workers or were they not included.  They were not included. It only covers U.S. companies and further classifies employees according to their employer's EIN.  So low-paid contract workers who work in Microsoft buildings, doing things for Microsoft, but employed through a subcontractor don't count against Microsoft's average wages.
Neither was the last guy. 
For a reply of "lol okay man", yea, that's about it. 
Settled for Bernie Sanders.
Cause it's EVIL. Companies should shouldn't have to rig the game to make a profit. They shouldn't be allowed to do so. And those tough new reforms will happen soon. Just be patient.   Corporations need to be more ethical. If that means taking out a few companies and purely evil people, they should get started 
From Fort Worth, I wear a stetson, a pair of tony lamas, levis, carry a rifle in the 4x4 truck at all times, more spiritual than religious: take in all the good parts of Catholicism, like taking care of people, and leave the silly shit like anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage, am a geologist educated by the University of Texas.          I'm also accepting of all genders, races, sexuality, and whatever; live and let live as long as you leave me alone.  Believe in climate change and work in environmental consulting to help keep companies compliant with regulations.  Love all food from French to Middle-Eastern to BBQ.  Am fairly well read and have lots libarts courses under my belt despite being STEM major.  Am a social progressive, but fiscal conservative.          Am a Texan first and American second, always.  I have a firm belief that the only region I can really affect is my state, and I feel like I can and should work to make it better where possible.  I don't agree with every SJW or anti-gun nuts, but I feel like there are areas we can make progress in to be more open but safe.          We're not all crazy in Texas, some of us are normal, well-rounded folks.  I like to believe the intolerant are merely ignorant and need to be  exposed to different folks and educated, particularly when it comes to the bible (not a bible beater, but am well read) and the old and new testiments and why Leviticus is wrong.
Which needs to go away. F corporations. 
&gt;  I was hit in the nose with a fastball in little league, had to have reconstructive surgery do to the pitchers unintentional bean ball. Maybe he should have been required to have fastball insurance since my dad's insurance was burdened with the hospital bills. Do you not see how ridiculous this is?  It seems perfectly reasonable to me that a baseball team would carry some liability insurance to cover their players.
I can't point to exact sections, but given that people living in states without exchanges are receiving subsidies, funds must have been appropriated somewhere in the law.
Hillary Clinton has committed crimes, but watch the stream of excuses from the Reddit Democrats.
If they had no regulation and no bailouts then they would have to become much more conservative in their risk taking, because if they implode then, then actually lose their money. Like banks ran for thousands of years.
Shut the fuck up
You clearly aren't familiar with the spectacular train wreck that is Paul LePage.
No republicans are a contender so we get to pick president from Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.  With that choice Bernie Sanders is the clear winner.
You should reply to the person who said they lived in 5 cities.
Suppose I'm poor and I hit someone with a rock, breaking their jaw in two places. Now what?
The Constitution clearly says anyone holding office cannot accept money from a foreign state.  It's cut and dry.  If we hadn't been wiping our asses with the Constitution for the past 50 years, Hillary would already be in prison.
I'm sorry you are upset but it's the truth.

Don't let him bullshit you. Many of the so called "tips" on that sub are either impossible for someone without starting cash of some kind, or require idiotic levels of sacrifice on your part.   Did you know that at 20k a year, you can get to 750k in just 37.5 years? Some jackass will tell you that, and leave out that's if you pay no taxes, live and eat somewhere for free, walk everywhere and LITERALLY not spend one single penny for the rest of your life.
Can we all just take a moment and slow the fuck down with the Bernie Sanders shit? Last I checked it's May 2015, and we all know he's not going to be the candidate. 
If I got pregnant and I couldn't get an abortion I'd probably kill myself. I want kids, just *having* kids would cause me so much pain and would leave me emotionally damaged. Making people go though that would be pretty shitty.
How is the Clinton Foundation not a charity?  &gt; cause for impeached former president Bill Clinton,  This phrase would seem to indicate there's nothing here.  &gt;has paid out pennies in relation to dollars received.   Doesn't appear to be true.  https://www.clintonfoundation.org/sites/default/files/clinton_foundation_annual_report_2014.pdf   
Yes because only liberals have exclusive rights on caring about for poor... Great logic there friend...
Good point...
&gt;The fed pumps money into the system because we use fiat money. The fed uses it to control inflation.   You mean, the Fed pumps money into the system to create inflation. The Fed has eroded 98% of the value of the original dollar they started with in 1913.  &gt;There is definitely conflicts of interest with the fed.   Obviously, it's owned by private banks and has been covering their asses more times than I can count.  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/26/will-secret-tapes-take-down-goldman-sachs.html  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-best-regulator-that-s-easy-it-s-the-market.html  &gt;But your accusation seems conspiratorial.  I mean the Fed does conspire with other banks including central banks to lower interest rates to bail out banking institutions around the world.  "When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, as the hand that gives is above the hand that takes. Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain."- Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.  &gt;What system?   The financial system which is composed of many subsystems. The Fed pumps money into the bond market with Treasury bond/bill/note purchases, they pump money into the banking system with Fed's funds loans and other interbank loans, they make loans to other central banks, etc. The Fed even has the Plunge Protection Team that directly buys stocks to support the market.  &gt;How does the fed printing money elevate the stock market?  Do you mean the controlling of inflation which affects consumption of goods which affects stocks?   It lowers interest rates to make owning assets such as stocks and property more attractive than holding cash which pays no interest and is sure to depreciate rapidly. Inflation forces everyone to become speculators and it pushes asset prices like stocks up because there is more paper dollars chasing after the same amount of assets. The extreme reckless speculation that inflation fuels is what creates bubbles and then a subsequent bust.    &gt;Also, you failed to mention the context of Keynesian. You know, that economic theory that got us out of the great depression .  Keynes's theories have rarely been implemented properly. In the mid to late 20s the Fed pursued very loose monetary policy during a boom and they blew up a stock market bubble with investors leveraged 10-1 on margin. As you can see from the essay, Keynes advocated for tight monetary policy especially during a boom; he advocated for governments to accumulate reserves during the boom so they can spend during a bust.     &gt;I've always hear libertarians argue that we should go back to gold standard and the fed should not be controlling inflation. Really? Do you libertarians even know why gold standard was chosen? Why is gold so special?  Gold has inherent value unlike a piece of paper that the government assigns value to. Gold standards have a strong tendency toward deflation which lowers the cost of living for everyone. It's not good for wealthy asset holders though.  "Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this world would be a happier and better world to live in. But if you wish to remain slaves of the Bankers and pay for the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money."- Sir Josiah Stamp, President of the Bank of England in the 1920s, the second richest man in Britain.
Citizens United made a movie. They were then told by the government that they could not advertise the film due to its political nature. CU argued that their film was no different in political scope than the films of Al Gore and Michael Moore. The Supreme Court correctly agreed.
Driving a car is a privilege where as owning a gun is a right. Secondly you drive a car every day, unless your law enforcement or in the military you're not using a gun every day, and guess what those two groups are exempt from the legislation. Once again the democrats say they aren't coming for our guns, but their actions are the exact opposite.
That should be his campaign slogan.
&gt;And I disagree with the opinion that everyone should carry insurance for every possible danger one might encounter in their life.  I didn't say that. You put out an example of what you're implying to be an unreasonable burden, and I stated that it doesn't seem unreasonable. It's basically workers' comp insurance for baseball teams.  I don't really care about guns, but your example doesn't help your argument. 
Money is not free speech. You referenced a Supreme Court decision in that regard, I assumed it was Citizens United, which, as I pointed out had nothing to do with money.

Thanks, captain obvious.  I was saying what I do, as an example of the attitude that people SHOULD have when voting.  I couldn't care less about either party.
Some libertarian views on the Washington Post Opinion page. 
You should read this: http://kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/an-overview-of-delivery-system-reform-incentive-payment-waivers/ It's a federal program implemented at the state level.  It is in no way an alternative as you have described it although I would not be surprised that the Texas pols describe it as such. 
Gun related accidents are generally covered by health insurance for any bodily harm. (Unless you have shitty insurance that doesn't even cover ER visits) If you somehow bang up your gun, you might be out of a couple hundred and at worse a grand or two at most. If someone dies, well fuck.   Car accidents on the other hand is much more frequent and in total has costs Americans billions. If we didn't have insurance, a lot of people wouldn't be able to swing 10Gs around to simply fix someone's car or their own. At worst another 100Gs for bodily harm, property damage, and other bullshit litigations.  Generally even with insurance with an accident that involves a loss of life, insurance isn't going to do anything for anyone. For the family that lost love ones, they would need life insurance. So the question really becomes, how the hell would gun insurance help anyone other than stuff money into  insurance company's pocket. 
They usually are.   Well, the ones who utterly failed any real economics class and have no idea what the cost of negative externalities ends up being.
Health insurance is for, you know, medical bills. Surgery. Therapy. Physical therapy. It isn't going to cover your lost wages or the lost wages of your family who have to quit work to take care of you.  Having some sort of firearm liability insurance guarantees that someone will be able to foot the bill for that because we as a society don't expect average Joe Schmo to have millions of dollars lying around to pay out a judgment because his son got his hands on daddy's gun and shot his friend or because you have a hunting accident with your buddy.  And can you really not appreciate the difference between a gun and "any other object that can cause injury or damage?" If a 9 year old picks up an aluminum bat and hits his buddy with it, can he paralyze the kid? Sure, maybe. Is there a chance that literally just by holding the thing in daddy's bedroom he's going to make the other kid's face cave in? No.  Is there an extremely high risk of death or serious bodily injury with an airsoft gun? No. You can put out an eye, sure. But you're not going to blow someone's brains out on accident.  I don't have a problem with people wanting to own guns. What I have a problem with is people who own guns who seem incapable of appreciating how dangerous they are and how quickly they can become a danger. For a kid to shoot another kid, all he needs to do is find whatever drawer it's negligently stored in. It's 10 seconds from the time the kid picks it up to the time he plunks one right in his friend's chest.  And if those sorts of accidents are so rare as everyone assures me they are, and maybe they are, then liability insurance for gun owners won't be that costly and people can stop complaining about how the government just wants people to have a high barrier to owning guns. It's just the same principle as car insurance. It's not some other expense to put on people to limit their ability to own a car.  It's an acknowledgement that we've made as a society- if you fuck up and ruin someone's life, they should be taken care of. And because most people don't have the assets to deal with that sort of thing, we have insurance to foot the bill. And it's not just in case YOU fuck up. If someone fucks up and hurts you, you deserve to be taken care of. Is that really such a horrible idea? That we have systems in place in society to guarantee that those who are seriously injured or ill are compensated so they're less of a burden and so they can continue to maintain some sort of quality of life?
Socialized medicine saves money. Financial deregulation costs money. Money spent on education has a large return on investment. Republicans are not fiscally conservative. 
who are you voting for in the primaries? Doesnt sound like Bernie Sanders.
Breakfast tacos here aren't even that amazing, you can get ones that are just as good or better in California. 
Problems exist with her analysis.  Redlining was a result of analysis, not of racism.  Lenders understood, because it was evident, proven, that certain minority neighborhoods were a greater risk than others.  In short, after decades of investment, it was clear that money invested in black neighborhoods (and Mexican, and Irish, Italian....), was more at risk than investment in Protestant, white, neighborhoods.  With that information in hand, investors did what they do...they assessed risk, and priced accordingly.  In other words, redlining didn't create ghettos, ghettos created redlining.  Claiming that education and redlining are directly related assumes that all states use the same funding systems.  I grew up in Kansas, in the inner City, and received a fantastic education.  Why?  Because Kansas's funding formula takes all countys' taxes as a pool, and then allocates based on the population density, so that the densely populated and fantastically wealthy Johnson County subsidizes it's poor inner city neighbors in Wyandotte County (Kansas City, Kansas), and the relatively wealthy KCK funds the very poor rural districts.  Kansas City, Kansas, which is separated from Kansas City, Missouri by just a state line, has fantastic schools that pay teachers well and offer excellent opportunities to students, while KCMO is unaccredited and roundly dismissed as a toilette of an educational system.  KCMO, which is a model of redlining, with the city divided to this day by a single street (where prices will literally jump by $200,000 from on block to the next) used a local property tax allocation method for school funding.  Interestingly, both cities have massively high black and Hispanic drop out rates, while whites (even poor white trash), in both cities, graduate from the same schools at twice the rate of their minority classmates.  The same story is repeated throughout the country.  Regardless of the location, wealth, opportunity...blacks and Hispanics perform less well than white and non-whites of European and Asian descent.    Science is about testing theories, and creating results than can be reproduced against controls.  This country offers countless opportunities for controlling for all sorts of microcultural variables, economic conditions, racial makeups, and every other variable imaginable, and overall, blacks and Hispanics under-perform wherever they are, and in all circumstances.  So...what does that leave beside the cultural differences between blacks, Hispanics, and everyone else?         
&gt; Denmark is for the most part a homogenous society unlike the US.  Yes, that's code for "blame the non-white people".

Magical time traveling Obama is up to his old tricks again. Remember when he went back in time and planted those fake birth announcements?  Maybe Hastert will use Gingrich's defense:  GINGRICH: There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate.
Well this is /r/politics...so probably not...
Great idea. Popular pardon for victims of the NSA. Start the petition!
Your friend and/or whoever was around him handling the weapon did something stupid.  I know someone who was injured with a chainsaw.  Would you be fine with requiring chainsaw liability insurance?
It's got a direct link to the interview, so...
Maybe in Somalia.  I tried a few times in America, they kept telling me to join the military if I wanted to use advanced weapons, and that I was now "on a list."  All I wanted was a goddam surface-to-air missile system, and they were treating me like some kind of crazy person!  SMH
Sordid?
Yep, I bet the local democrats have taken tons of your guns away. Bet they're banging down your door right now to do it. This garbage about taking your guns is propaganda from gun manufacturers. You've been duped. 
I'm a little surprised that Rubio, Cruz, or some other prominent GOP legislator didn't make some kind of effort to derail this in the time allotted to Congress to prevent the removal of Cuba from the list. 
So of someone owns guns and doesn't hunt then they're living in fear? Jeez, the anti-constitution guys are really stretching it. 
Let's just wait for pregnant steel workers to chime in here. I don't mean that disrespectfully, I mean that we have a lot of men that just love to speak for these women "for their welfare" and that needs to trend down. Women know exactly what they're capable of when pregnant. We don't do this to men with bad backs or other long term health issues, and it would strike us as absurd if we did.
Citation needed.
&gt; No. You don't consent to being pregnant when consenting to sex. You don't agree to a car accident when driving a car.  You certainly "risk" pregnancy when having sex just like you know there's a chance of an accident when you're driving a car.  
This is not a place for common sense!
Marriage and abortion rights are just a distraction. Everyday a little corner of America sees a victory for their party and has something to cheer about. Our game of thrones fighting pits. Meanwhile at the top politics is just an extension of corporate infrastructure where bills are made in the boardroom and sent down to the boys in d.C. to make things happen. 
Yeah except that Texas only attracted companies because they offered them a bunch of handouts, Texas is already barely functioning because of poor schools and health care. It's only going to get worse, and companies are going to leave once they legally can. Just like every other previous city that once offered handouts to entice companies to move.
They may know what they're capable of, but they don't necessarily know what their unborn child is capable of tolerating. We're happy enough to throw stones at women who drink, smoke or snort coke while pregnant (and rightly so).  If that sort of job were to have similar effect via heavy metal exposure I'd say it's a fair stance to take that it should no longer be their call.   Not saying I've got evidence that's the case but simply that your analogy to physically infirm but non-pregnant persons isn't a good one.   Working hard while pregnant? Sure, that's your call. Go for it.   Working in a setting that's got a demonstrably deleterious effect on the embryo you're fully intending to carry to term? You're a selfish sack of shit.
Look up the NY Safe Act. It's already made all magazine 10+ rounds illegal and you cannot purchase or transfer any AR-15, or AK patterned rifles. So when a family member passes away you cant legally give the gun to your family anymore, you have to destroy it. So it will take guns away from owners eventually.  
I might not be as informed as you on this. Just what companies are legally required to be in Texas? +1 for shitty schools though
Seriously, the "criminals will just break the law anyway" argument gets used all the time. Nevermind that the whole purpose of having a law is to allow recourse when someone does something that is damaging to society.
I think they meant 4 mile radius.  When nobody wants to run for town council in a town that's 93% black, the 8 KKK members get acclaimed. Then again, I'd vote for the Devil if she'd outlaw pants to the ground (if that was a problem in my city).
So is a background check. 
I for one am very glad that I wasn't aborted. 
oh yeah Clowns in Gowns - high priests of bullshit
alec.org? Uhhhh  And health care is not all nationally subsidized. Texas blocked Obamacare
Weapons aren't that cheep.  I'm pretty sure most of them are beyond the expected means for poor and lower middle class citizens.  Hell, for the price of an AR-15 or an AK, a family could eat for a month.  Not saying it doesn't happen, just that they might have other concerns than the in-ability to buy a weapon.
Says the person who referred to people of Central America "brow people".
That's not how statistics work...your experienced with firearms and you know how to best mitigate your risks.  Power too you.  If there were a test that you had to pass to own a firearm, to take care of it and mitigate the risks like you and your friends do be a compromise?  You pass the test you can own a gun.  If you can't, you can take the test again after study and prep.  Compromise?  The adding the insurance is that "test".  The "do I really want this?" and "can I accept the this responsibility behind exercising my right?".
&gt;I don't like change  [Oh snap!](http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/boss-gifs.gif?gs=a)
Libel insurance actually exists.  It's not mandated by the Federal Government because the people and businesses that need it get it without being told.  They KNOW how expensive libel suits are and don't want to be financially responsible for getting shit wrong.  If they don't have it, they could lose everything.  Are you sure you want to treat negligent firearm discharge suits the same as libel suits?
Russia is not totalitarian either. Authoritarian, but not totalitarian.  North Korea would be the only totalitarian state currently in existence. There is a story about an escapee from North Korea who read the novel *Nineteen Eighty-four* and thought George Orwell had visited North Korea and then wrote the book about that.
Why? 
&gt;Having some sort of firearm liability insurance guarantees that someone will be able to foot the bill for that because we as a society don't expect average Joe Schmo to have millions of dollars lying around to pay out a judgment because his son got his hands on daddy's gun and shot his friend or because you have a hunting accident with your buddy.  Please. Like private, for-profit insurance companies are going to fork over millions of dollars for some poor sap's healthcare. 
&gt;In actuality, yes they have. I live in NY and our democrat Governor made it illegal to own the most popular rifle in America. Further he banned guns based solely on cosmetic features on those rifles. So don't get on your high horse and tell me democrats don't want to take our guns away. Just admit it, you don't like guns so you don't think anyone else should have them.   You don't know me, don't pretend to know what I like and don't. A large portion of my family is either military or police, everyone has guns, and I live in a blue state jackass.    &gt;It's typical progressive thinking. California has an approved list of handguns that can be bought, gun isn't on the list, civilian can't buy it. That's taking something away, just by another method. Someone stated it before, it's just a way to make gun ownership so onerous and expensive as to be out of reach for the poor and lower middle class.   Right, I'll buy that when the south admits that voter id is meant to disenfranchise the poor and minority voters. Till then, laws like background checks and banning of certain weapons are just people making sure certain weapons aren't going to people who aren't supposed to have them
not a conservative, a republican.  Republicans used to be a relatively more liberal party.  Their ideology did a 180 while their name stayed the same.  Conservatives of the 1800s were more likely to be Democrats than Republicans.
Wouldn't those low end (low manufacture quality I'm assuming) be the ones most in need of liability insurance in case of accidental discharge?

This "conflict" between Saudi and the US is fake media outrage, there is no conflict.
Who is to say the employer didn't decieve them into taking the job? Who is to say that every other employer doesn't do the same thing? Why wouldn't they? If you went back to the 1900's everyone employer practically had bad environments. her   In what world are you living in where employees can quit their job and have the luxury of finding another place? That is absurd. Quiting the job means no wage and no money.   It is laughable that liberatrians think this is a good argument. Yeah, lets not stop employers from treating their workers poorly. Lets force the employee to choose between starving to death because they have no money or quit their terrible job.
"Lets have poor people tell everyone how not to be poor..." ...rly? A prosperous country is one where intelligent people get to do what they want. Having an idiot take the lead will only result in collective idiocy. Having an intelligent person take the lead will result in some annoyed but better off idiots. Don't let feelings control prosperity.  I'm not quite millionaire, but here's some sage advice for you; If you cant afford crayons, you cant afford kids. Don't have kids. Learn to control your dick, it ll make life a lot more affordable for you.

Taxes are the price we pay to live in an civilized society. Anyone who doesn't like it can go live in a cave.
Well, the moochers need to, the illegals need to be sent away since they shouldn't be living illegally in a country they don't belong to.
And who are these people reporting the news... ["Study after study by the Media Research Center, the parent organization of CNSNews.com, clearly demonstrate a liberal bias in many news outlets"](http://cnsnews.com/about-us).  I'm not saying they have an axe to grind as I've only spend 30 seconds looking at their organization but I suspect they are grinding away. 
It might actually be more than firearms. Accidental firearm deaths are actually fairly low. 
I've met many people on the internet claiming to be atheists and espousing all kinds of socially conservative views. However, I have yet to meet a single one in real life. I'm not saying I'm certain they're disingenuous, but I have grown skeptical.
Accidents are also declining. I am unaware of any changes in the number of suicides by gun. 
&gt; Regardless, the way I used the word murder did not derail the conversation. I used it as a substitute for the word killing, as that's what it's commonly understood to be.  It's not synonymous with killing at all. You're using it to inject emotion into your stance on abortion. Which is not murder. Clumps of cells are not people. So your actual arguments hinge on your assertion that it's murder. That's why I'm pointing it out.

Or we could go ahead and you know, not care. Seriously people care about this? I watch enough news to know that on any given day this doesn't even hit the radar. How about we all grow up and focus on real problems.

&gt; Thanks, handful of senators!  Fun fact: [Every single Democrat in the Senate voted for more bulk collection.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/s194) Every single one. Bernie and Elizabeth too.  (Yes, I know that upsets a lot of r/politics readers. The facts are the facts.)  If your Senators voted to extend bulk collection, call them today! They'll vote on the bill again tomorrow (Sunday the 31^st of May) and only need two additional votes to get it to pass. It's critical to change a few Democratic votes from YEA to NAY. 
Read Orwell's non-fiction.  
The more laws you have, the more law breakers you have.  How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.  I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.  If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes.
But the people who feel pro-choice won't based their vote solely on that issue. Most won't consider the issue at all when voting. Whereas the pro-life voters absolutely rule out voting for a candidate if they are are not also pro-life. And this is why abortion is a losing issue for pro-choice people.

&gt; where is the money to replace this income going to come from?  Education.  Always education.  The people currently receiving the benefit from that either can't vote or usually don't until they're older, so there's no immediate affect on the prospects of your political party.

&gt;“Only about 50 percent of the American people take the time to understand important issues,” he said on his show this week. “Half the country does not; they are simpletons, unwilling and unable to discipline themselves into formulating a philosophy of life.”   -  Sounds a lot like Jonathan Gruber, a professor at MIT and an architect of Obamacare describing the writing of the law: "Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical to get for the thing to pass."  -  The only thing you can glean from this is that both left and right think half the people are stupid. Sadly, they are both probably right. 
Truly unfortunate that the Republican party has a number of decent, intelligent, moderate leaders yet at the national level the party is run as if it were a cult of extremist morons. Snyder would be crucified by the hard-right on the national stage, which is why, if my calculations are correct, Republicans don't stand a chance of winning the Presidency.

We need to just divest ourselves completely from the middle east and let them kill and burn each other until they return to the sands they came from.  No place for savages in the 21st century.
I'd venture to say it is probably the guy.  
&gt; Everybody has moral values they force on others. For social conservatives, it's Christian stuff. For liberals, it's stuff like environmental conservation, anti-discrimination legislation and affirmative action, animal rights, etc. Authoritarians always try to impose their will on others.  There is a huge difference between one set of morals to control people whilst the other side has morals which protect their freedom; it is a false equivalency argument in much the same way that so-called 'independents' play around trying to make out that the crazies in the Democrats are some how 'equal' to the crazies in the Republicans.
Before I switch my support from Sanders, I'll need to know his position on deoderant and child starvation.
Funny thing about that , bp and Exxon are largely in favor demonstrating the link between carbon and climate change. If you read BP's 2035 market outlook they support a carbon tax.      The reason is that most energy usage is from industry not transport and most industry power comes from coal. Taxes on carbon shut out coal mining in favor of BP's gas exploration. Also, for the large part OECD usage is fairly flat and the vast majority of growth is predicted in the east (India/China). Climate change is a great opportunity for the US and Europe since we possess the technology for renewable energy and the US has tons of gas reserves. The only people against it are coal dinosaurs.      TLDR: Fuck coal.
Yes.  The 2nd amendment gives everyone in the US the right to any weapon, no matter how powerful, including ones used by terrorists to shoot down passenger jets, and suicide vests.  And it also doesn't say a single word about guns.  Guns not mentioned once in the 2nd amendment.  Firearms not mentioned once in the 2nd amendment.  
The cheapies tend to blow apart more than accidentally discharge.   The manufacturers figure it's cheaper to settle a few lawsuits than build a sturdier gun.  Too many lawsuits, they simply close the doors one night, and open under a new name.  *See history of Jiminez.  But yes, even the mid to higher end ones have had recalls due to accidental discharge issues.   *See Beretta Neos faulty safety.  I think another was Springfield XD series.  My personal opinion on what Glock calls a "Safety switch" is that it's downright dangerous.  Others say "keep your bugger hook off the bang switch".  They're all supposed to survive a drop test.  Modern ones usually will.  My personal opinion on the accidental discharge is that most of the time it stems from carelessness,  and/or lack of training and practice.   Of course,  the cost of training and range practice is a factor.   Ammo prices alone preclude many people from practicing as they should. 
From what they tell me, they are tired of rude people, high taxes, poor city services, cold winters, high crime, crumbling infrastructure.   IF you think making snarky comments anonymously from your PC makes you superior, that's OK with me.

I'd have to read a version of what he wants signed to know for sure how I'd feel about it. The roving wiretaps example is a good one. Obviously in a world of burner phones a single line wiretap is nearly useless. I would want LE to have access to a roving wiretap with a warrant and evidence that someone or someones are planning or involved in late scale financial or violent crime. 
Oversimplification does nothing for anybody. I'm disgusted by the smugness you managed through a freaking talking point. Birth control is not that simple and it's irresponsible to present it that way.
&gt; Let's you really see ~~his~~ the majority of people who vote's priorities of false security over freedom.  This is probably the correct version.  I'm not a fan of the Patriot Act, but if something actually *did* happen that someone could even half-credibly claim in an attack ad was because it lapsed?  Everyone who tried to hold it up will not win their next election. 
That's the job of media as propaganda in our inverted totalitarian state. Make any and all outsiders into weirdos and crazies. It doesn't matter that he's a fairly normal guy speaking very rationally. He's an outsider and all outsiders are crazy and dangerous. 
Hey, don't give our rightwing redneck prime minister ideas !!!    They're never been more prisoners in Canada since he's ruling the country.
Apparently, cutting the budget ALONG with a tax cut was not a viable option., because screw common sense. As a Kansan, we are ashamed and upset.
&gt; “I have to talk to myself about it before I reach that step,” said Senator Les Donovan, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate’s tax committee. “I’m not in favor of raising taxes. I’d much rather be able to see growth take care of what we do.”    You have to talk *to yourself?!?* Maybe you should be talking to other states' representatives and see what has worked for them. Or  maybe economists other than those of whom you're a fanboi.

Then I must admit that I am not clear on the point you are making.
So it's your argument that unless someone transforms into a swan, the concept of rape didn't exist until the mid/late 20th century?    You've written out the actual truth of the matter, then glossed over it because it's uncomfortable: **"So by that definition, no sex was ever consensual at all."**  Even if we grant that a woman of the time could give consent to the degree that she was able, **you still have no evidence that Sally Hemmings wanted to have sex with her slave master.**  Children couldn't give consent in the 1700s either, if TJ had raped a 14 year old that he *didn't* own, would that have been immoral?
They're slaves. It's cheap labor to increase profit margins of those who utilize them. Slavery is explicitly legal in our Constitution, so long as the slaves are incarcerated first.  This is why our laws are designed to keep prisons full, and our population brainwashed to believe all convicts deserve their fate. 
I wish that statistic were more promising, but keep in mind that most of those Democrats were from before the big 1968 Party shift in the South, where anti-Civil Rights Democrats became Republicans, and pro-Civil Rights Republicans became Democrats.  So, those old-school Democrats were Republicans (in modern terms.)  I miss Ann.
Obama, the Democrat, taking the rights' position, and Rand, the Republican, taking the lefts' position; it's like Bizarro World!
Sorry, what he DID in power.   
Truer words have never been spoken.
"inaction."  I wasn't aware that trying to keep something from passing/being renewed was inaction.
Except for the fact that they aren't slaves. 3 free meals and a bed is more than I'd give an rapist or murderer. So what they have to break a sweat trying to offset the public's cost of housing them. 
In the past wars were fought over [salt](http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Oil-Into-Salt-Independence/dp/1439248478) and it would be nice to see the bottom drop out of oil's value soon.
Meanwhile, one guy is standing the way of a decent presidency. 
I accept and appreciate your thought,  and understand how you can see that.  Maybe a need for the terms of good and evil sex are necessary.    And while I do agree with you,  it doesn't mean that it is not sex.  However, I wouldn't ever be so casual with a victim and try to demean them by comparing rape to normal sex.  
Just going to point out that since it's inception, the ONLY reforms to the Patriot Act have been done through executive action by Obama.
America's golden years were the years with the highest income taxes.

From a Marxist perspective, it makes perfect sense.  The GoP is for the most part pure class warfare from above. Raise margins of profit and income of the bourgeoisie, stick it to the poor and working class. This is capitalism at its purest *including* its contradictions, for example the problem that capitalism wants strong rates of profits (which rely on demand) and low wages (which mean low demand) at the same time. But from a bourgeois perspective, low local wages beat out high strong demand because goods can just as well be exported and sold overseas.  From a systemic standpoint the Democratic party effectively ends up doing the same for the most part, although they are ideologically closer to social democrats (accepting the necessity of capitalism while trying to use the state as a tool to protect the working class from the powers of capital), which results inconsequential and confused politics and hypocrisy.   They are the embodiment of the dual character of the state, which fundamentally enforces the interest of the bourgeoisie (maintenance of private property of land, means of production, and resources, as well as maintaining a rate of profit) but also provides limited means for the self-defense of the working class.  The odd ones out are the Libertarians, who want to maintain the state as the source of power of privately owned capital but get rid of its other functions (worker protection and corporate welfare), which works for neither side: It screws the workers but also destabilises the economic system. Our current "crony capitalism" phase began exactly with an economic libertarian mindset - the neoliberals practically started from the current capitalist-libertarian position, then found out that keeping the state out completely fucks the economy, and turned into "pro-business" politicians.

I would say unless the woman signed up for that then you would still be forcing an operation on someone that doesn't want one. If a woman says "no, I don't want that procedure, I want this one" you can't tie her down to a table and force her to have it removed and grown somewhere else. While it is inside of her and she is providing it with life, she has has the say in how it's removed. 
let's compare apples to oranges shall we??? 
The American government made it a crime for Americans to spend money in Cuba. There was nothing illegal about US currency in Cuban law though, so tourists who had US dollars could exchange it for CUC's (Cuban Convertible Pesos). There was 10% penalty on the exchange rate though, so most tourists used Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, or Euros instead as there was no penalty.  tl;dr I've exchanged money in Cuba, and have seen people exchange US dollars with no issue.
Please consider deleting or editing your comment because it's confusing a lot of people. A vote for cloture, especially in this context, is just a shitty way of pushing the bill without making yourself look awful.

As described by Martin's friend at trial, Martin attacked Zimmerman without provocation because Zimmerman was a "Creepy  Ass Cracker" who must be a "rapist".
As a Democrat, that's stupid.  I don't LOVE the dentist, but I go because I acknowledge the necessity.  See how that works?  
[deleted]
commenting on the nature of the gun is not an attempt to cast a moral judgement. it is a recognition of the reality of the object. in societies with less guns, there are less gun deaths. stating this is not tautological.
The same thing can be said about Martin though. I don't think  there is a clear answer to this case, it's just what do you believe who's right.
To Fill Budget Hole, Kansas GOP Considers the Unthinkable: ~~Raising Taxes~~ Thinking.  There.  FTFY.  I shake my head and wonder how a formerly-modern country came to have one major party organized around open rejection of rational thought.
Ohhhhh snap mother fucker was corrected and debunked.  Ninja style.
Detroit metro has a higher population than Kansas. I am as liberal as you can get but curious about your reasoning here.
Or just because it's Obama's bill 
Except that Martin wouldn't have had a problem if it wasn't for this weirdo cop wannabe pursuing people at night. There's no neighborhood watch in the country that allows that. Zimmerman has since pulled a gun on his girlfriend. Who does that?
Yes.  And even when you include local taxes and sales tax, the tax burden faced by Texans is one of the lowest in the nation.  AND Texas pays more to the federal government in taxes than it gets back, despite having a pretty big military industry in Texas.
We're talking about the op-ed section here. It's a cesspool just somewhat less toxic than the WSJ.   Not that I'm aware of *any* op-ed section that is not shitty in its own disgusting way.
Martin's friend was on the phone with Martin at the time he attacked Zimmerman and throughout almost the entire encounter.  She is a witness to the running description of the events as described by Martin as they occurred.  As she testified Martin expressed a racist General hatred of white people, Creepy Ass Crackers as he called them.  And he expressed his racist claim that, being a Creepy Ass Cracker, Zimmerman must be a rapist.
Could have also aborted the next Hitler. Worth?
Considering that Zimmerman is famous for killing a man it shouldn't be hard to establish that one would fear for their life while in a conflict with him. 
&gt;The quoted statement is false.  That's why I questioned it.  Is it wrong to be right?  &gt;On a brief review it looks like National Parks might be able to enforce restrictions.   Maybe.

No Republicans are opposed. A few want spying reserved for the private sector, thus they want government out of it.
He was talking on the phone to a friend.  I call my friend Liu, who's parents moved here from China before he was born, chink.  Am I racist?  Nope.  He calls me a beaner (and I'm not even Mexican!).  Do I think he's racist?  Nope.  Maybe the creepy and rapist part make you think it was racist.  But given the context of him being followed in the dark by him, creepy is a fair descriptor and rape is a reasonable fear.
I think sales tax on food is barbaric. Growing up in Oregon I already think sales tax is bad but when taxing food you dispuportionally hurt the poor.

Martin attacked Zimmerman for being a Creepy Ass Cracker who had the audacity to get out of his car.  More to the point, Martin approached Zimmerman, not the other way around.
This was exclusive news that came out an hour ago. I expect (hope) this will be all over the web by the end of the day.
I'm pretty sure Bernie Sanders was an independent.
If the Freedom of Speech clause exists for any reason, it is to protect political speech. That is not arguable. I imagine most of the other "kinds of speech" you believe to be illegal either aren't actually illegal (like shouting fire in a crowded theater), or are not political in nature (fighting words). The intent of the Freedom of Speech clause is core behind why such limitations can exist.  The only type of political speech that I can think of that is (while not illegal, limited) are direct contributions to an individuals campaign. This is because the Supreme Court has held that the act of running for public office is not political speech in and of itself, and thus can be somewhat regulated.   But you are suggesting that  the government be allowed to ban political documentaries and ban people and organizations from making public political statements. Planned Parenthood would not be allowed to make an ad saying "Oppose this anti-abortion referendum" or say that "So-and-So opposes birth control". There is no way that is not political speech that is protected by the First Amendment.   And again, whether or not the law was good has no effect on whether or not it was Constitutional. Striking down that portion of BCRA may very well have has a toxic effect, but that portion of the law was still clearly unConstitutional.
Yes, Zimmerman was certainly a creepy white man (I've heard he is half Hispanic, but in the dark I can see how it would have been difficult to distinguish when he can reasonably be confused for white in broad daylight) following him in the night.  Zimmerman was following Martin in the dark, Martin feared for his safety and decided to stand his ground.  Zimmerman shot him for having the audacity to stand up to the threat he was reasonably perceived as being.
I've been looking for details of how exactly the mechanism will work, but there's scant news right now. The article says he can likely block the bill until Thursday, three days after the law expires. If nothing else, the dynamic will shift significantly and force a broader national dialogue.

And they worked for it. Inmates are in prison for something committed towards humanity that humanity deemed uncivilized. Slaves aren't.   Edit: ok. Bad statement. I didnt mean to imply slaves got what they got because they worked for it, but because they had to. I meant to compare the fact that slaves worked because they had to, no questions asked. Inmates are responsible for paying for their stay and nothing but people screaming slavery comes up. Why shouldn't they. If they were on the outside, they'd still have to have a job to contribute. 
The racist fear of Creepy Ass Crackers is not reasonable.  Violence motivated purely by racist fear is not reasonable.  The racist defense of racist violence is not reasonable.
It's funny how hard you're trying to prove Texas' prosperity is only because of government tax breaks
And we get good service from the government now? 
You're assuming there was a racist fear because he used the term cracker.  Like I said elsewhere, I call my friend Liu chink, he calls me beaner.  And guess what, even if Martin was racist, it doesn't mean he wasn't justified in perceiving a threat.  He certainly was.  A man was following him home in the dark.  He stood his ground, failed, and his killer got away with it.

Zimmerman *is* a creepy ass cracker.
Ok I'll bite: what is a "reasonable fear of death?"  Sounds like your bar is pretty high...
&gt;Inmates are in prison for something committed towards humanity that humanity deemed uncivilized.   I completely disagree.  Smoking a harmless plant?   Wrongful incarceration?

I'm not saying it's all peaches and rosebuds.  In fact, I'm saying EXACTLY what you're doing:  /r/politics cherry-picks things to make their ideas seem agreeable and the ideas of others seem idiotic.  Rather than thoughtfully considering the ideas of intelligent critics, /r/politics focuses on the most pedestrian examples of sarcastic mockery and then says "why don't those idiots agree with our ideas?"  It's because "those idiots" do the same thing as /r/politics and they say "look at Detroit and Baltimore . . . that's what happens when Democrats are in charge."

This is a sad state of affairs, but doesn't have much to do with the minimum wage sadly.   Nobody really knows why it's happened, but the increased role of automation is the most common theory amongst economists. As computers became ubiquitous, you could multiply productivity through software, which didn't require nearly as many workers. Facebook, a $200B company, employs only 10,000 people. That's tiny relative to more labor intensive firms of the past. Software has allowed companies to concentrate and manage their businesses with many fewer employees. This applies down the line in all industries - I'm a lawyer, and we employ far fewer lawyers, secretaries, and paralegals than a firm of similar scope would have had to before. The reason is our IT has gotten so good as to eliminate those jobs.  The information age is a good thing overall, but it's also probably to blame for stagnating wages.
For comparison, in 2014 Kansas state and local spending was $8,310 per person. Texas spent $9,130 per person, Oklahoma spent $9,157 per person in 2014. 
I'm currently supporting O'Malley. My hope is it's not improbable and he takes the nomination.   Edit: downvotes for supporting a different candidate, awesome
I won't be supporting O'Malley. He did an AMA last year that went terribly. He failed to answer many questions, and most of the answers he gave did not answer the questions very well. Excerpt from AMA: &gt; Governor, under your second term, taxes were raised and dozens of fees were, in some cases, doubled, all within eighteen months, during the worst recession this country has ever seen. Gambling was approved and then expanded by voters with your encouragement, with the money promised for schools. However, as far as I know, schools have not seen an increase in funding. Why are taxes and fees going up when it was promised that legalized gambling would prevent this? And why is that money not going where it was twice promised to go?

See, this is the kind of shallow, partisan garbage that makes me think Obama is probably right.
Because it's bullshit and is harming the poor for no reason.  A sales tax hike hits poor people many times harder than it does wealthy people.  
So...you're saying Martin deserved what he got?  I'm having a hard time understanding your commandments.  A kid is dead because a guy with poor impulse control wanted to play cop.  "Creepy ass cracker" has nothing to do with the events that unfolded.
but it's impossible to know the statistics because politicians beholden to the NRA prevent the FBI from maintaining meaningful data on gun related crimes.  a single gun can kill many, many people when it "accidentally" falls into the hands of madmen, which it often does because of the lack of restrictions in many jurisdictions to prevent mentally ill people from acquiring large capacity semi automatic firearms.  obviously this conversation is going nowhere.
From the article:  &gt;The Advocate requested copies of his emails last month  And  &gt;Louisiana residents may never see any emails Jindal has written during his time in office, thanks to broad exemptions in the state’s public records law.  
So, continuous practice is required to keep in good shape and practice with your firearms.  It costs money.  How is that not a financial barrier from safely owning a gun?  Call the insurance a "lack of practice" insurance then?  Both ways mitigate the financial risk to the owner: one by having money there if it goes off, the other knowing what not to do with it in the first place.
I have absolutely no use for Rand Paul, he's a complete nut job.   But on this issue he is 100% correct.
Your reasonableness and rationality are not welcome here.
Highest minimum wage adjusted was when we were still on gold standard. Hmmm. Guess it wasn't a total disaster...
When bush was re-elected in 2004, I thought we would probably need 20 years of decent progressive presidents to repair the damage done by Bush and for the US to fully recover.  If anything, we've started to recover from the damage Bush did to our country a little faster then I expected; I'd say we're maybe about halfway there now.   We've made some progress in reversing the damage Bush did terms of economics, climate change, and some other areas, at least, although we're still not back to where we were in 2000 in any of those areas.     Of course, electing another Bush now (or someone even worse) would probably do enough damage that we might never recover from it; damage like that is cumulative. 
Not all. Please don't misrepresent my words.   You said   &gt;Inmates are in prison for something committed towards humanity that humanity deemed uncivilized.  I would argue that MANY are in prison for non-violent drug crimes which are more of a health issue than a criminal one.   Not to mention your sweeping statement completely ignores the wrongfully incarcerated. 
How do you define Fox News if not corporate? They don't give a shit what the White House or Pentagon says.
Very few people are in *prison* for simple possession.
No, but ever 10 years there is a US Census.  It should record everything to provide numbers for governments to properly establish spending over the next 10 years, things like road maintenance and school funding.  If an area has a higher than average firearm population per household, they could enable a discretionary fund to cover costs of accidental discharges and in other areas not have that cause its a gun desert.
Oh please, Rand has gotten a ridiculous amount of attention on this sub over this in the last week. He isn't the only one in congress fighting this, he is just the biggest attention whore on this issue.

No.  I make no claim about "deserved what he bot".  The observation of fact is that Martin initiated the violent encounter without provocation.  He ot what he created.  I'll leave it to you to decide for yourself if Martin deserved the consequences of his actions.
They simply blame Obama.  The election ads in Kansas were soooo shameful.   They generally didn't attack Brownback's opponent's positions, they simply flashed his picture, then Obama's.  The narrator then said the candidate was just like Obama.  No specifics, just association.
Which is why the story of the Mad Hatter was born.  Slow, small exposure leads to danger over a long scale.

&gt; just because Sanders and Warren voted for cloture, it could mean they have no desire to re-extend the Patriot Act and don't want to hear any more debate.  I called Sanders' staff, they didn't have a statement to share with me to explain his vote either way.   His website is sanders.senate.gov and his D.C. office phone number is (202) 224-5141  Be polite. Don't yell. He's got young adult staffers working the phones and their job is to tally the opinion of callers.  I said I was disappointed with his vote on the USA Freedom act because it extends and expands Section 215 of the PATRIOT act. If nothing ever passes, or if we never go to a vote, Section 215 expires on June 1st. This is the best outcome. The EFF agrees.   Remind them that Bernie has been consistently against the PATRIOT Act and you are confused on this vote.  Call even if you're not from his home state. Bernie announced, he's running for President and your voice matters.  
Yes, and even including local taxes, Texas has the 5th lowest tax burden in the United States.
No it's not. Read the definition of cloture. Cloture *can be used that way*, but you're assuming that it always is.   Like assuming that all people who are shot were shot in self defense. *Your* comment is the misleading one. No one should assume that cloture votes are for ramming a bill through.
Sure. But that's not the same thing as mandating insurance for something that is statistically not an issue.
Behind a paywall? No problem  TOPEKA, Kan. — With the state facing a $400 million budget hole for the coming fiscal year, the conservatives who dominate the Legislature here say they are agonizing over the likelihood of doing something that did not seem to be in their DNA: raising taxes.  Just three years ago, many of these lawmakers passed the largest tax cuts in state history, saying they would lead to economic growth. But that growth did not appear, and after repeatedly trimming spending to close shortfalls, legislators again find themselves in a prolonged budget battle with no easy answers, where both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature are proposing tax increases.  The reason: even anti-tax Republicans are acknowledging that there is not much more to cut without significantly hurting popular programs, including education.  The fault lines now seem to run along the question of which taxes to raise. Some believe that income taxes are off limits and that they should raise sales taxes to shoulder the entire burden. Others advocate a mixed approach and said income taxes should be on the table. Democrats argue that increasing sales taxes would be another blow to low-income Kansans to the benefit of the business class.  And many worry that the only solution will be to repeal the signature piece of the law they passed in 2012: the elimination of taxes on certain types of small businesses.  “I have to talk to myself about it before I reach that step,” said Senator Les Donovan, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate’s tax committee. “I’m not in favor of raising taxes. I’d much rather be able to see growth take care of what we do.”  Mr. Donovan has proposed removing the exemption on nonwage income for small businesses, instead giving them a 1 percent payroll tax credit. His bill also calls for increasing the sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on everything except food, which would be taxed at 6 percent.  The tax battle has pit conservative against conservative and produced all sorts of procedural bickering and legislative posturing. As lawmakers have vowed to work through the weekend, the legislative session will reach the 100-day mark on Saturday for just the sixth time in state history. (Sessions are typically limited to 90 days, and each additional day costs around $40,000.)  In addition to ending taxes on some small businesses, lawmakers passed legislation in 2012 and 2013 phasing in rate reductions on personal income taxes — to 3.9 percent from 6.45 percent on the high end and 2.3 percent from 3.5 percent on the low end — by 2018. The reductions were expected to cost a total of about $7 billion through 2019, according to legislative researchers.  Since those changes, Gov. Sam Brownback and lawmakers have found themselves repeatedly tinkering with the budget to fill hundreds of millions of dollars in shortfalls. The governor has cut some state agency budgets by 4 percent, reduced contributions to the state pension system and shifted money between state accounts. Lawmakers have rolled back funding for poorer school districts and changed the way they allocate money to schools. They have slowed funding increases for entitlement programs.  Mr. Donovan said the results of the tax law were “never as good as we hoped.”  “We hoped they would just be a magic lantern and everybody would react to it,” he said. “But, eh, it’s hard to get a company to uproot their business when they’re established and move to another place just because of this difference in tax policy.”  Still, supporters of the tax bills are not necessarily willing to concede that the cuts were the reason for the state’s fiscal problems.  Senator Terry Bruce, the Republican majority leader, said that when the cuts were passed, the Department of Revenue gave estimates of how much the changes would cost that ended up being inaccurate.  While initial estimates, for instance, were that the small business tax exemption would affect about 191,000 entities and cost about $160 million, for the 2013 tax year, 333,000 filers took advantage of the exemption at a cost of $206.8 million, according to the Revenue Department.  “I don’t know if it was a mistake and the intention was wrong or the effect is wrong,” Mr. Bruce said of the tax law. “It was very aggressive, very quick.”  The House plan would tax the nonwage income on small businesses at 2.7 percent and increase the sales tax to 6.45 percent, but reduce it to 5.9 percent for food.  Some Republicans are holding the conservative line, saying cuts to bureaucracy could close most, if not all, of the gap.  “There’s definitely waste in the budget,” Senator Dennis Pyle, a Republican, said in an interview. “It’s my goal to not raise taxes. We have to let the private sector breathe and operate as freely as possible because that is the revenue driver.”  But Democrats called the Republican proposals inadequate for fixing the budget woes. “There’s a lot of things you could do to show that you are concerned about all Kansans,” said Valdenia Winn, a Democratic representative. “But are they doing it? Nope. So your little piecemeal baby steps don’t impress me one bit. They’re desperate because you still have those Tea Party people who cannot go home and say, ‘I had to vote for tax increases.’ ”  Some Kansas small-business owners were mixed about whether they needed the tax exemption.  Ryan D. Hall, who started his own radiology company in central Kansas last year, said he was not receiving the exemption because all of the money his limited-liability company earned was counted as wages, and the exemption applies only to non-wage income. Yet he said that he hoped to expand his business, and that if he hired employees and bought a building, the exemption could come in handy.  “It would be nice to have down the road,” Mr. Hall said of the exemption. “They could close the deficit without eliminating this particular provision.”  Marena Mitchell, who runs a speech and occupational therapy company in suburban Kansas City, said she appreciated the exemption. Still, she was not even sure how much money the exemption had saved her company, Bringing Therapy Home, since she formed it two years ago. If it was significant, then losing it might increase costs, and she might have to pass those on to the families she treats.  Yet as a former speech pathologist for a school district, Ms. Mitchell said she would support giving up the exemption for the right reason.  “I would be O.K. getting rid of that exemption if it supported education,” she said.

It seems to work for New Hampshire, although I'm wondering if increasing property tax like NH did would make up for the shortfalls if Maine axed income tax.

&gt;  In reality Texas is in a bad spot and its starting to hemorrhage jobs b/c the state is dependent on oil and since oil prices tanked, its suffering.  Texas has 4.3% unemployment and yet you're spinning it as them having a crappy economy due to job loss.  &gt;At the beginning of the Kansas melt down, a lot of people were sympathetic to the plight of Kansas.   What a load.  Not even close.  /r/politics was cackling with laughter from the beginning.
If who was then, now is what?
No it doesn't mean that. The vote linked by the parent comment is a cloture vote.
All of my wat. This was released by his supporting super PAC. Sweet Jesus.
It's because pro-Israel elites run the media. He's not pushing the USA Freedom Act to protect America, he's doing it to protect Israel. We must continue to fight Israels war and collect intelligence for Israel.   We call it "fighting terrorism" but it's really "helping Israel". Any representative who doesn't do what the pro-Israel elites want won't have any chance of winning an election.   Edit: just to be clear, I'm Jewish and I love Jews. The Israeli government is not representative of all Jewish people and anti-Israel is != anti-Jew.
Wow. There's a lot of confusing stuff there. Not sure where to start.
Technically you are correct. In the practical world, where you and I have to live, I'm still correct.  Do you want to end bulk collection under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act or argue semantics? It's effectively a vote for more bulk collection. 
You're not paying a huge bill, though.
Da joos.  Edit: I didn't mean to claim you were an antisemite, but some people seem to turn every issue in the United States into something that only exists because of strings being pulled by "elites" from Israel. Lots of high ranking American politicians do not support Israel, yet people act like the entire U.S. government bends to the will of evil Zionist overlords with stacks of holocaust apology money. 
The wealthy pay MOST of the sales taxes.  And while they pay a lower *percentage* of their imcome during their earning years, they will pay a higher share during their retirement as they spend more of it.   The net effect is that they will pay far, far more taxes when the sales tax is raised than any poor person. 
If they can get 60 votes to evoke cloture, they can usually get 51 to pass the bill.  Sometimes Senators will try to lie to you and vote for cloture on the bill and then vote against the bill when it comes for a final vote. The bill passes anyway and they get to claim they opposed it. But it's total BS, and lobby groups like the ACLU and EFF usually score on the vote for cloture, not the final vote.
Republicans are garbage. It is so obvious that the GOP is in the pocket of the wealthy elite and yet dumb dumb Americans keep voting them in.
&gt; Can someone from Michigan please call our PM, Stephen Harper, and tell him that "tough on crime" doesn't actually work?  Crime is down all over the U.S., why are you saying it doesn't work?
And yet I disagree - "[Congress has] also done less than any other Congress" - I see this as a wonderful thing! They "...helped [promote] people and policies that are currently reverberating through our lives and it. fucking. sucks"   The less they do the less they mess up!  It do not see it as myopic to go back to the dawn of the "progressive era". That is where we fundamentally went off the rails as a nation. That is where we started getting involved in every foreign issue, socially engineering the American people, and fundamentally transformed the relationship between the Federal government and the citizen.  Short-sided would be to only go back through what we have personally experienced, the direction started with TR "are currently reverberating through our lives and it. fucking. sucks."  Of course, this mistake didn't begin with TR, it can be traced back decades before - it just starts to get blurry when you start going back further.
When the right wing of the US went so far to the right that liberalism is now what conservatism was 30 years ago.  
This is why I think Greece should default and leave the Euro.  They have no way out of this without regaining the ability to use monetary policy.   I actually think you'll eventually see other countries leave the Euro as well.  Unless Europe decides to make the EU their central government , there's just no way this eventually doesn't become a problem for others.  The EU works as a trade union.  But the common currency is actually hurting a lot of countries in it.
That's basically what being on the gold standard did. Given that gold was the money, a wage based on a fixed amount of gold would automatically follow inflation and deflation.
Well gosh I could have told you that. There's a classified document that the President has that allegedly states: "saudi arabia funded or gave shelter to the 9/11 hijackers before they carried out the attack".

Depends on the cost and quality of life.
For this to work dozens of senators have to fight it, why is Rand Paul getting all the attention?
Said it before. With control of both the House and the Senate, people now see the burden of action on the side of the Republicans. It's why Barack's making so much noise when he clearly can't pass anything he wants anymore. This could carry over to 2016, which already looks to favor Democrats in the Senate, and with some luck, the House as well.
New study reaffirms link between climate change and trying to tax us more &amp; gain power over us.
&gt;Plus good schools/parks/neighborhoods matter more than low taxes because then workers are willing to work for the company.  No firm will move say 1000 75k jobs to a State that can't keep its schools open a full school year and has to use teachers as the janitors.  The little everyone saves on taxes isn't worth the cost in amenities or the extreme instability.  There are plenty of neighboring States with the same cost of living (which has a much bigger effect on the bottom line than the tax differential) and great balance sheets and well funded schools.      
Here's your problem.  I am a small business owner. I can't pay $15 an hour. I'll go out of business. We (small businesses of less than 50 employees) are combined an ENORMOUS chunk of the job market. You will put us all out of business and here's why:  Costco and huge corporations want a $15 wage because it doesn't affect their bottom line. A Costco worker shuffles around $20,000 worth of retail merchandise in an hour. A barista a Starbucks making $15 still moves $2,000 worth of coffee in an hour.  An employee for me picks, packs, and ships 6 orders of which I was only netting a buck an order before the wage hike. This is my opening position, I have several employees making around $20 and hour but I myself make about that once all the expenses and hours are factored into what I take home AS THE OWNER.  So I'm not telling you what is right. I'm telling you what the consequences are. In my opinion as a business owner and a former wage worker the minimum wage is used by corporations to put small fries out of business and we'd be better off with no minimum wage. People should be allowed to negotiate their own wages.
And the money saved by reducing income tax and having low capital gains tax completely overshadows any sales tax. The issue is that low income people don't save money on reduced income tax, but they do lose money (which they don't have much of) on sales tax. 
Technically correct is the best kind of correct. 
They won't raise taxes on the wealthy....so don't worry so much! They only ever plan to decimate the non-wealthy by raising taxes on small businesses, sales taxes, and probably cutting child credits. 
Good thing we have honest politicians like Clinton who would would never sell out to billionaires
FAA regulates ALL airspace in the US. Essentially you are back to the public road issue. Additionally, insurance is required to operate, not own, which becomes an important distinction when making the comparison to guns. Also, ultralights are not regulated.  If you could "own" your airspace then no, insurance shouldn't be required for non commercial private use.
&gt;Every democrat voted for more bulk collection  They essentially *did* since that is what the vote for cloture leads to.  You can argue semantics all you want but it doesn't change the fact that if they wanted to stop it from being passed they'd have just joined the filibuster. 
What do you mean?
This has been explained on here before to be a myth.  The "effective" tax has always been about the same despite the tax bracket changes.
We call them patriots. We don't need an act called "The Patriot Act". We need people to stand up to tyranny.
Because that's the minimum wage or maybe the value of their labor?
Not only have they not moved here, one of the largest ones left: Boeing. Thousand of jobs, gone for good unless they sell their old factory in Wichita to some large multi-national aerospace company.
Despite all the psychological profiling, this study doesn't show anything but correlation. I think if you took any two hallmarks of liberals and conservatives, then polled for them, you'd get the same kind of result. 
I acknowledged that...If you have a more recent study that does the same thing I'd love to see it. But otherwise, this is the best I've got.
Citizens United was actually a victory for free speech. The decision had nothing to do with money or corporate influence. Liberal extremists decry the decision because they only want to allow speech that they agree with.
And how much you make.
This freedom of speech favors a very small percentage of Americans. But I'm sure everyone who doesn't like it can just "geet out."
Why doesn't Obama admit that [he's a Republican?](https://doughenwood.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/92392289-fitch-on-obama.pdf)

Huh?  But /r/politics told me that meanie rand was The big hypocrite man for voting against that.  I thought he was the bad guy making this a GOOD bill?
1. The very first thing I'd do is look into automating my shipping process as  much as possible. I already did this once about 10 years ago when I invested in about $20,000 bucks worth of used carousels to make my "pickers" more efficient so I could hire less. I would do this right away it would be my number one priority to automate with my existing capital now for fear of not having the cash to do it in the future if stuff doesn't work out well. I've got to invest in capital to make the employees that I previously valued at $10 an hour worth $15 an hour. Otherwise I have to fire that person. I can't lose money every hour they are at work and believe me I wasn't making $5/h off of her $10/h wage. It's more like .25/h once you do all the math.  Thousands of other business owners would do the same. McDonald's and most other fast food chains would start using keypads for people to place their orders.   http://time.com/3623893/mcdonalds-tablets-ordering/  You don't make people more efficient by raising the minimum wage, you just make it illegal for them to work. McDonald's doesn't want to do anything illegal, so they will switch to kiosks. Guaranteed.  2. This is too hard to work out. I deal in discount cabinet hardware. So a lot of it I have a high margin in, but I also have to sit on it for awhile. I'd have a lot of trouble figuring out what I needed to do price wise to account for all that if it just jumped to $15, but I'm assuming it would slowly rise so I'd just gradually creep everything. I'd say by the end of the deal I might have a 20% increase in overall retail prices, but that's just a guess and it would be different for each individual business. It wouldn't be a ridiculous raise in prices at all really overall i don't think. But the point I made in part one is the part wage workers need to be worried about.  Edit: I swear I put "2." for the second part and it shows a "1." no matter what.
Virginia is a shithole. Every road has tolls and you need to pay property taxes on your car every fuckin year. Hate that fuckin state. Get a job there since you love it so much.
&gt;  If it had increased steadily, as prices did, minimum wage would be about $15 already.  No it wouldn't? If it increased according to inflation *at its highest point ever*, it might be a bit more than $9. (And that's cherry picking). If it kept pace according to inflation at *inception*, it would be $3.45 (from the article).  &gt;Also, if you think having a bunch of people with no purchasing power is good for the economy then I believe it's you who doesn't understand economics. More rich people with more money don't buy as many products as those minimum wage or near minimum wage workers would purchase.  Your goal of raising the minimum wage is to stimulate the economy? While we're not in a recession? I...question this. Even if we *were* in a recession, you know there are a million and one more direct ways to stimulate the economy right? So if this is your goal, it really doesn't support raising the minimum wage.  &gt;If more people are buying products then demand goes up. If demand goes up, employers will find a way to meet that demand, i.e. hire more employees.  Outside of this really long causal chain, is there empirical evidence of this? (As in a peer reviewed study)  &gt;This might mean that in the short term employers need to take a pay cut themselves or create a better business model, but it doesn't mean it's impossible.  I don't think the standard should be "Oh! It's not impossible, let's do it."
Ignorance abounds! Many founders wanted and planned to end slavery as time went on. However, the survival of the fledgling country was of greater importance than immediately  ending slavery. Preserving the country took precedence.   Aside from all of that, you create a false equivalence. Gun ownership is entirely different than slavery. But, to be fair, you better believe that an armed abolitionist was better than an unarmed one.  The next time you try to mock someone, you better know what you are talking about.
There is all sorts of debate on why crime is down. I don't know how you can just flatly state that the "tough on crime agenda" doesn't work.   
This is the best politics that Koch money can buy...
It's not greed. To pay the workers any more would be charity. Why should Walmart pay their employees more than they are worth?
Have you ever read what the University Healthcare Plan offers? It's next to nothing. Literally that.  I am low income and qualified for Medicaid because of the Affordable Care Act. Without the ACA I cannot qualify.  I am working on finishing school, but that shouldn't justify telling someone to ignore their own well being.

Have you researched any of his positions or do you just get your political news from this subreddit?
Still better than McCain or Romney, and it's not even close.  
But that doesn't follow the same reasoning. That would be like extending healthcare to the poor, which we already do. Single payer would be quite different.
You compared them as though they're under the same influences, have the same power to enact their own policies, are equally isolated from adjacent geographical divisions. They're not.
When the Democrats raise taxes and don't get the results they want, their solution is to raise taxes again. At least the Republicans are willing to try something, admit it's not working, and try something else.
Small businesses already get jerked off by both parties. They can't say enough good things about them. They're much more likable than big businesses and don't pull as much offshoring / tax haven use / regulatory capture etc.  I don't think people hate big businesse per se. It's more that they hate their negative behaviors and the idea that they make their own rules. For instance, you don't hear much Costco hatred because they don't give people as much cause.
Hey! Is it that time of year again? When republicans once again raises sales tax to fill the gaping hole in their budget and reddit and other right wing media comes out in droves to defend them.   6 years ago is the first mention I can find of it: [Those leftist fools have yet to realize that it is not income that should be taxed](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8h6nf/bloomberg_richest_person_in_new_york_refuses_to/). Search for it and you'll find the same argument every year: [raise sales tax](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=raise+sales+tax)  The large majority of redditors are poor, lower class, southern conservatives who can barely afford food and still every year they fall for it. :D hahaha It's amazing what you can get poor people to vote for when you pander to their racist side.  
I don't know how the car thing works, but on a smaller scale, I used to work for an Apple retail store in Oregon (no sales tax).  We'd get people from Washington state (no state income tax) coming in all the time from Seattle to make $3k+ purchases to avoid sales tax on it.
&gt; Government waste is rampant regardless of the party  Conservative Mantra: Government sucks!  Therefore we'll elect the shittiest politicians ever to make the shittiest decisions ever!  And when we wind up in a massive shortfall due to their shitty decisions, then it's the fault of some inherently dysfunctional government that just sucks!   Of course it has nothing to do with who I elected who just fucked up managing my state's economy!  Government just sucks!  /conservative (il)logic
Don't worry.  He'll just later say "Free Mary Jane for everyone!!  Also, wipe away all college debt!!" and all will be right with Reddit again.
**Fact #6:** Minimum wage screws the poor to benefit the middle class.  * Firms are assumed to be profit-maximizing and individuals are assumed to be utility-maximizing. So individuals want to earn as much money as possible (positive supply curve) and firms want to pay as little as possible for a specific labor (negative demand curve). What happens is that firms hire and keep hiring as long as the next employee they hire has a marginal benefit greater than the marginal cost to employ them. When a price floor is instituted, some employees will have a marginal benefit lower than that new minimum wage. Now the marginal cost is greater than the marginal benefit and because firms are profit-maximizing, those employees will be fired or not hired. Which sort of employees will have the lowest marginal benefit to their employers? Those that have the least skills and experience, which are the poor and lower class.  If that isn't perfectly clear, here are some videos that may explain it better than text.  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjD23OcVJvk * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1Moeaa-W8 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQj1qlsjVoM
You consider "history" to be a threat of violence?
Progressives don't do the whole "lockstep with the party" thing like Republicans do.  We tend to welcome at least some degree of variety in our members.  That's why every single group other than straight white Christian cis-males votes Democrat more than Republican; no matter who you are (other than a white straight Christian cis-male) you'll likely be better represented by them than the lockstep Republicans.
I know it's not the popular answer, but wage freedom is what we need. No minimum. I'd suggest looking into Walter William's writings on the way the minimum wage is destroying the black communities. It's used to keep us down.  The original article here showed that the highest inflation adjusted minimum wage was 1968 just before we left the gold standard. Another chart in the comments shows the direct correlation of wages to productivity shift massively right at the point we left the gold standard in 1972: http://i.imgur.com/lkOaehQ.png  The gold standard kept wages with inflation because gold was the money. The gold standard isn't perfect but it was good for the common person to be paid in something of real value other than paper crap they can print at will.  Walter Williams - George Mason University
&gt;we'd be better off with no minimum wage. People should be allowed to negotiate their own wages.      Thank you. If two adults agree to a certain wage theres no reason why it shouldn't happen.
Cutting taxes and spending less money doesn't mean you're being fiscally responsible or more efficient.  You can quit your job, sell everything, move to smaller apartment and spend less.  Doesn't mean you're necessarily making sound financial decisions.
It's an old story... I'm right, and my reasoning is sound; therefore if you disagree with me you must be too stupid to understand what i'm saying.
Because admitting democrats lie during campaigns to that degree basically undermines the whole: "Liberal savior, republican destroyer" narrative pretty heavily
Yeah, that's my plan as a Sanders supporter (save that since I live in Georgia and the state is very unlikely to go blue, I'll probably vote Green.  But if polls show it being remotely close I'd vote Clinton).
I'm not racist -- as I've explained, [using slurs isn't racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOnkv76rNL4) -- but even if you want to go on pretending I am, it doesn't mean I'm wrong.
No. You have to look past the disconnected rhetoric and read the Supreme Court ruling. It said any entity that produces a film should be allowed to advertise it and not be subject to arbitrary political parameters established by the government.
I'm pretty sure everyone still hates Obama.
Why should we assume that a person who has been convicted three separate times for a violent offense is not a danger to the community? It is not comparable to the US locking someone up for life in prison for failing to return a videotape, but that a person who has been convicted twice before for rape and is being convicted a third time should not have the opportunity to go out and do it a fourth fifth and sixth time.  The Canadian Laws on the matter are reasonable.

&gt;What is a reasonable fear of death? That wasn't rhetorical.  Whether a reasonable person in that situation would have believed the alleged attacker intended to cause grievous bodily injury or death, was physically capable of dealing such damage, and had an opportunity to deal such damage. That usually means that if a man is attacked by another man of roughly the same size, who he has no specific reason to believe has a weapon available, he does not have reasonable fear of death. When Martin had Zimmerman's head against the pavement, the pavement became a weapon available to Martin to use, so Zimmerman had reasonable fear of death. Martin never had any reason to believe Zimmerman was capable of killing him, until after Zimmerman had reason to believe Martin was capable of killing him and so drew his weapon and fired.  &gt;It's absurd that a person who was followed, confronted, and then killed never had a "reasonable fear of death."   Not really, as long as he didn't know about Zimmerman's gun. Prior to the point where the pavement became available to Martin as a weapon against Zimmerman, and Martin, by attempting to punch Zimmerman's head into it, demonstrated he was willing to use it as a weapon, Martin had no reason to believe Zimmerman was physically capable of killing him.
You are missing the point.  Recent case law requires that a person invoke their 5th amendment rights, elsewise it is considered waived.  It is not automatic.  If a police officer wishes to state that they do not wish to make a statement given that it would self incriminate that would logically indicate that there needs to be an investigation as to why.  That is the way it works with the rest of us.  There should be equality under the law not some "more equal than others".
Today I learned that explicit acts of racism aren't racist.  But a Creepy Ass Cracker getting out of his car is not only a racist act but also an explicit act of violence.
That's only the correct answer if, as governor, you care more about national politics than about unjustly disenfranchising citizens of your own state.  Maryland is mathematically the most gerrymandered state in the entire union. That's not something to be proud of, or dismissive about.
Most people I have engaged on /r/politics do not actually know his positions and as a result have a negative opinion of a fictional racist, sexist, homophobic, war-mongering straw man.
Abortion is very psychologically damaging, there are studies on that.   And yes when you have sex you are biologically consenting to the possibility of conception. Maybe not mentally, but you know pregnancy is a possibility. Just as someone who smokes cigarettes may not be consenting to lung cancer but that's a biological response to the action. 
The circlejerk in this sub needs to end. It really is the shithole of reddit for a reason.
http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/26/409793452/federal-appeals-court-leaves-hold-on-obama-s-immigration-orders  &gt; The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will not lift a hold that has stalled President Obama's plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The president sought to give temporary protection to people who were brought to the U.S. as children, and to the parents of people who live in the U.S. legally.  &gt; **The decision blocks an executive action the White House issued late last year** and leaves in place a hold that was issued in February by District Judge Andrew Hanen in South Texas.

&gt; Hell, I think a moderate GOP candidate would be able to easily win a presidential election, but getting through primaries as one is a pain in the ass  Perfect example: Jon Huntsman, Jr.  Could've won the general...but too sane for Republican primary voters.
...or maybe we just have a problem with a guy who, like his father before him, spends all his time telling us how horrible politicians are, while doing everything in his power to be a life-long politician.  If Rand Paul really believed his own line of bullshit, he wouldn't be in politics.  He'd be out in the private sector, practicing what he preaches.
Cognitive dissonance is a bitch
The one where everyone stroked him off the whole time? Yeah, I saw it. 
I've always been curious what gun advocates feel the country would be like if there were no gun control laws.
link? otherwise BS
&gt; Guidelines are 30% of income for rent, so a single person would need an apartment costing $321.36 per month  Yeah rent is seriously like double or triple that easily even in the best areas
Haha. I'm sure snide comments make you feel good. But it doesn't help the guy that doesn't have a job because it's illegal for him to work.  I am in a rural community. $15 an hour would be in the top 20% of wage earners where I'm from probably. You would destroy everything. You need to educate yourself on freedom brother. Stop trying to control everyone. We can negotiate our own wages thank you very much.  Edit: Just saw the second part of what you said. Typical. You know my business better than me and you know also know what's good for all my employees without ever having met us or seen our individual circumstance. Attitudes like yours are what's ruining the country brother. Join us on the side of freedom and minding your own damn business!
Unfortunately, you're not an economist, and you're just spouting low-level basic rhetoric.  You're ignoring the fact that paying people more dramatically increases demand, which will lead to more sales, and thus more jobs needing filled to meet that demand.  **Continually cutting wages will only kill the economy, because the economy is driven by poor and middle class people spending money. Wages are not bad for the economy, and never will be in any realistic sense.**
Classic.    "B-b-b-ut look over _there_!"
&gt; Why should Walmart pay their employees more than they are worth?  Why should a corporation exist that can't pay living wages?
Hilarious that when conservatives actually agree with liberal philosophy there is still a giant anti conservative circle jerk.
&gt; Maryland is mathematically the most gerrymandered state in the entire union   Not true, MD ranks number 10 and the 9 above are all Republican.
Cue concern troll Libertarian that would rather wine about the other guy than talking about the subject at hand.   I'll hold my nose and support Rand on this one because the stars align. That doesn't mean I agree with him on a vast majority of his positions, or the ever changing landscape of his philosophical outlook. 
Are you like me?  Do you think this video is a crock?  This video was obviously put together by someone who has never actually got their hands dirty by running a real business.  Any one who isn't an effete elitist ideologue knows that you are already pricing your product at the maximum that the local market can bear.  McDonalds has this very specifically worked out. They know if they raise the price of that burger, one more penny, exactly how much profits will fall.  It has little relationship with productivity or with labor costs.  If the price of my raw materials goes up (lets say pickles in this case) and I am already pricing my product at the highest price I  can in the local marketplace; I will just have to eat the increased price of pickles by lowering my profits.  This is how business works in the real world.  Now lets just replace "pickles" with "labor" and watch the pompous pretenders who have never run a business tell you all about how labor costs are different. On a real world balance sheet - they are the same as any other cost.  Labor costs - just like pickle costs - are driven by market forces.  If people do not want to work for you at $7.25 an hour then you need to raise your wages.  If pickle suppliers join together in a consortium to screw you over on pickle prices it may not be fair, but pickle producers are trying to maximize profits too.  Why shouldn't labor try to maximize their profit the same way?  Unless you really do not believe in unbridled free markets, labor should have all the advantages as everyone else participating in the marketplace.  As far as employers replacing people with automation because of higher wages?  REALLY?  Every employer is always looking for a cheaper and more efficient way to do things.  If you think McDonalds is not going to replace people with automation - regardless of labor cost - then once again - you have never run a real business in the real world.  Honestly, these sorts of things piss me off because it is always a bunch of goofy kids in their moms basements who put these types of videos together to bolster some sort of ideological point of view.  People like you and me who work everyday in the real world are too smart for this b.s. it is damaging the economy and it is simplistic.
Looks like a full two line self-contradiction to me. 
&gt; The purpose isn't to stimulate the economy with demand...The point of bringing up demand is that the negative economic benefits are not so straightforward, and job losses due to minimum wage changes depend a lot on what kinds of models the economists start off with when trying to isolate the effect.  The problem is, inevitably people bring up this demand idea and when I try to discuss it, they pivot to, as you'd say, "humanistic" goals. I'd appreciate a consistent message about the goal so that we could discuss it.  &gt;the purpose is to provide a certain standard of living to workers, so as to receive other sociological benefits of a well-fed, stable, and healthy population.  Which I think is a great idea! But the EITC does so in a *far* more targeted fashion. I'd fully support expanding that program (particularly to adults without children, I think that's a politically convenient restriction, but one that shouldn't be relevant)   Because at the end of the day, by increasing the minimum wage you help the standard of living for *certain* workers. And this is the majority of workers, granted. But you irreperably *harm* the standard of living for the poorest/least skilled workers. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that trade off. Especially when the EITC doesn't make us create that trade off.  &gt; The models don't show many losers in that situation.   In the higher minimum wage situation?
They're a lot less cool now that you don't actually have to stand and speak though. Some cool filibuster stories in our history.
Not from Maryland, but all I know about him is that Matt Drudge has a hard on for him
Entry-level workers who get priced out of a small job never get the chance to get their foot in the door and gain some experience.    That's a lot worse for the economy in the long run.  99% of us never had our dream job at first, we worked some crappy jobs and built the experience needed to get us to our better current jobs. 
From the editorial:  &gt; That obfuscation is also understandable. You simply cannot be a leader of the Republican Party without appearing to know less than a fifth grader about earth science.  That's a great line, and I wish it wasn't true.  Anyone capable of being nominated for President in the Republicans Party today would inevitably be an unmitigated disaster as President.

This is currently in 4th, and much newer than the ones above it. From the looks of it, you posted this pretty much the same time as the link was posted. You're looking for outrage.
yeah, cool. and on the other hand, all the big money/billionaire democrats seem to agree on just one candidate  it's hilarious to me that people around here make the GOP party members out to literally be the devil while Hillary is a whore for Wall Street and other big money interests.    both parties are corrupt and you're all fools. 
I think the real reason these Republicans consistently get into trouble is that when they get nervous or pressured (or when they think they've got a friendly conservative audience) they accidentally say some of what they really think.
His idea of "going out of business" probably means he'll have to take a hit to profits and won't get to buy a new bass boat this year. 
Yeah, that's why I'm keeping an eye on the polls (and am involved in activism which I hope will help swing it that way).
thats because Rand Paul wants big government to be the final arbiter between a woman's uterus and a fetus, and he spends more time blaming Obama for the nation's problems than people like Sam Brownback.  
You're simply wrong.  Your judgement of "wrath and obvious pride" is nothing more than a petty attack on your part.  To be quite blunt, I'm beginning to question the veracity of this poll altogether.

Remember when Romney said that Russia was our biggest geopolitical opponent and the democrats laughed at him?  Remember when John McCain said that regardless of how we got there, if we pulled out of Iraq the area would collapse into sectarian bloodshed and the democrats called him a doddering old man?
He is asking in what way are they incomparable. Merely restating a very vague word is not going to show him what you mean. He understands the meaning of the word as obviously seen in his directed questions. Reading comprehension works wonders :)
&gt; You're ignoring the fact that paying people more dramatically increases demand, which will lead to more sales, and thus more jobs needing filled to meet that demand.  Let me ask you a simple question: Clearly you believe strongly in that line of thought. When does it *not* occur? IE: Under what conditions will raising the minimum wage not cause that to occur? 
Have you been outside of a solid blue metropolis?  I'm in north central FL and I can assure you, they legitimately believe all that crap.
Still better than either of the alternatives.  Not a great set of options but it is what it is.
Nahhhhh duddeeee this is just where we trash talk republicans and collectively ignore any bad things democrats do
It's great that reddit is giving credit where credit is due, but let's call a spade a spade: Rand is a terrible candidate.  Rand Paul is [too close with the Kochs](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/239059-rand-paul-pens-tribute-to-koch-brothers).  He supports citizens united.  He opposes Net Neutrality.  He wants to give our Social Security  to Wall Street.  He wants to turn our schools into a new corporate profit stream.  He supports the regressive flat tax.  He wants to turn our inner cities into Economic ~~Freedom~~ Exploitation Zones.  His economic policy consists of typical right wing corporate tax giveaways, the weakening of labor protections and cutting of valuable social services for the poor and middle class.  He thinks business should be able to discriminate against minorities.  He opposes gay marriage and reproductive rights for women.  Despite his populist rhetoric, he has the [most right wing voting record of anyone in the running](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/enten-datalab-cruz-1.png?w=1024).  The list goes on and on... 
Hillary would never have the courage to do this.
That doesn't include hospital stay. Social work is like rehabilitation. It doesn't cure any chronic diseases or illnesses they've developed on the streets. 
Well having one federal system doesn't help any of that though.
Way to sensationalize, you are fundamentally wrong and most likely missing a ton of context. The political process isn't as cut and dry as you are trying to make it. There are times when you want a bill to move along quickly so that REAL votes can be tallied. Sometimes you move it along because you see there are not enough votes to pass it, and you want it voted before that could change. Cloture is completely different from voting for a bill and does not necessarily have any correlation. 
Because sales taxes hit poor people many times harder than wealthy people.  Most poor people live week to week spending everything they get instantly.  There is no investment, there is no saving. All Kansas did was move the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor.  
He probably should have asked "When did the Democratic party turn into a bunch of Right Wing whackos?" 
Yea fuck all that red tape. This let's the cops get back out on the streets shooting civilians faster. 
The gerrymandering in MD is among the worst in he nation. West Baltimore (one of the poorest neighborhoods in America) is grouped with Howard County. A county that is voted top 3-5 every year in wealth and education. It's terrible. The people who are actually intelligent to know the views and sides are completely voiceless
Citizens United produced a film. They were told by the government that they could not advertise their film due to its political nature. CU argued that their film was no different than the films of Michael Moore and Al Gore and this should be afforded the same rights.  How does this decision in some new way equate money and speech?
Until 1984, social security income was not taxable. Thanks to saint Ronald Reagan, my elderly parents pay taxes on income in excess of 25K.  Fucking republicans.

&gt;If that wasn't enough, he wants to cut taxes on corporations by over 50%.  Well that's something I'm sure we can all get behind.
District compactness is a poor measurement of gerrymandering.  Instead, what matters is the results of the shapes of the districts.  How gerrymandered a state is ought to be measured by the difference in the state's partisan makeup versus the partisan makeup of the representatives they send to the house.
hahaha this is great. i'm in no way a republican, what evidence was your outrageous assumption contingent upon? just because i pointed out that both sides are corrupt and toxic? if you check my comment history you'll see that i'm pretty libertarian in my views and harp on both parties constantly. there is actually a comment from a while back where i say that i can't stand republicans more than  democrats.   i'm an idiot though for pointing out both parties abuse the decision of citizens united. gosh.  
DAMN FAGS RUINED OUR CHANCE AT HUNTSMAN!()@#)(*!#(@)!@()q
Please then explain to us why the top two political contributors in 2014 gave more money to Democrats than the top 50 gave to Republicans.  https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php  
His wasn't bad, but there wasn't much new stuff. 
He wants to privitize Medicare and make huge cuts to food stamps, medicaid and other basic safet net programs for the poor. [And he wants to eliminate all capital gains taxes](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/03/25/1771561/the-5-worst-things-about-rand-pauls-budget-proposal/), which is where the super rich make most all of their money. doesn't believe the science behind anthropogenic climate change, ect. His position are basically all Koch bros wet dream with some populist anti spying stance sprinkled on top.
Pretty sure Bernie Sanders believes what he says, and he's been saying it for thirty years now.
I'm almost certain all of the people bashing Rand Paul in this thread don't even know what his views actually are. They just saw the (R) next to his name and started ragging on him without second thought. 
Don't forget there are corporations that piece meal themselves by divisions and departments. So any given big business could be made up of 10-15 "small businesses".
Um... NO.  That's not what that means, at all.    They didn't vote for more bulk collection, they voted to take the issue to vote.  To stop debating the topic.  **It literally says it in the link you provide**    &gt;This was a vote on “cloture”, which means to end debate so that an up-or-down vote can be taken. A vote in favor is a vote to end debate and move to a vote on the issue itself, while a vote against is a vote to prolong debate or to filibuster.  Most of them have historically voted NO on the bill itself.   Further, delaying the bill's vote by a few days does virtually nothing to actually stop it.  Stopping cloture only means it can be filibustered.  Rand did stage something of a filibuster, but not on the day it mattered, and not for long enough. The bill can still, and likely will, be voted on. It's simply Rand making neat sounding headlines without actually accomplishing anything -- a.k.a. political theater.  If it weren't then he would have filibustered in a meaningful manner.  
Well the past few decades of punishing and shaming them didn't entirely work, so it's actually time to double down. More punishments, much more shame! That's the 'murican way
And of course, as soon as a woman is running for president, all the hateful conservative assholes come out of the woodwork to use anti-woman slurs against her, like calling her a "whore", while pretending that they're talking about some larger issue in the hopes that people won't notice the slur.  Typical, I suppose; we saw the exact same tactic used with racist slurs when Obama was running. 
You mean whine endlessly about how dems are just republican lite and hardly better.
His economic policy is worse than just tax cuts for the wealthy. He, like his father, supports Austrian monetary policy (how we largely control the economy). This calls for the end of the federal reserve and a return to a gold standard. Every reputable economist knows this is a horridly bad idea and would be disastrous to the macro economy. While he is the closest republican to liberal social views his economic policy makes him the most dangerous man in this race hands down.

Religion is mind poison. 
And we can maintain competition in the market if get rid of government influence such as corporate subsidies and tax breaks.
2015..calling obama supporters left wingers
It is my observation that the new page is avoided by them at any and all costs.  I can understand that policing the new page of endless reposts and off topic posts is not as much fun as chastising users, issuing warnings and banning account names.  
Ok, here's what I think is going on.  You are Virginian, probably lean conservative, figured you would take a quick shot at Maryland, it didn't really work out and you haven't quite figured out how to stop digging the hole you are in.  It's easy.  Just put the shovel down.
Social work is many things, it can help people learn what kinds of help (medicare/medicaid, permanent disability coverage for example) they can access. If Utah accepted medicaid expansion they would be covered.  For the future this (providing homes and social work) helps to prevent would-be homeless from developing homelessness related mental illnesses, diseases and injuries that would necessitate emergency room visits.
Maryland takes the cake by that metric too.  [Democrats in Maryland get 62% of the vote and 88% of the seats, amounting to a 26% gerrymandering advantage that is the largest such boost, for either party, in the country.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/republicans-gerrymandering-house-representatives-election-chart)  --Mother Jones
No. I'm pretty sure I was referencing how all of hillary clinton's top donors are big banks and defense contractors. Don't try to create arguments that aren't being made. 
The electorate is absolutely dumb. They consistently vote against their economic self-interest in favor of social policies that are way more intrusive on the part of the gov't than anything suggested by liberals.   I'm okay with politicians I disagree with, but the ones they elect are ideologically inconsistent, and they're getting in the way of modern progress on the national level. I'm not big on the liberal circlejerks that regularly break out in these comment sections, but I detest even more when people want to seem centrist and fair by criticizing both parties equally. The conservative ideology is based on bad economics, boot-on-the-throat foreign policy, and hate of minorities. I'm sick of people pretending that their view is just as valid. Many of these are *measurably terrible* policies, especially when you start to get into austerity policies. The liberal party certainly has its flaws, but at least they attempt to address problems that are grounded in reality, like poverty and infrastructure, rather than imaginary religious persecution.
"Kansas lawmakers think tax cuts will bring increased business, forget no one wants to move to Kansas"  ^Should have been the headline
He isn't even that close on liberal social views, he just uses effective though lame states right rhetoric to dodge social issues and gay discrimination. Just the other day he said ["crime isn't a racial thing, it is a spiritual problem."](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rand-paul-chicago-visit-met-0528-20150527-story.html#page=1)
To say it eliminates every medical cost is naive. 
No, it's not essentially that, at all.  He points out sanders, so let's stick with that: sanders has always, in 100% of the cases, voted against the bill.  Never once voted for bulk collection.    Just because he's not trying to make a pointless circus show of the political process for media attention doesn't mean he's trying to provide support for the bill.  
If he didn't agree with it, he could easily use his famous pen. Truth is, he is an authoritarian.

&gt;Up to a point.  Exactly. And that's the key point. A lot of crimes are stopped because of a network of laws.   &gt;That is why mandatory minimums and other laws that are redundant to already harsh penalties have very little additional deterrent effects.  You don't know that. It depends on the specific case. You needs a network of laws to work properly prevent crimes and other problems.  
If that wasn't what you meant, then perhaps you should try to choose your words a little more carefully.  All the conservatives calling the first woman candidate for president a "whore" or a "bitch" certanly are giving off the impression that they have a problem with women.
And so once again, you've failed to prove that Obama's Executive Order has been struck down.  Does it please you to fail with such frequency?
That and the fucking Electoral College which should be completely abolished.  It makes all other states except those with the most Electoral votes completely irrelevant.   
I think Europe is a great example of capitalism done right- the main tenant of capitalism is mutual gain. When CEO John decide he wants to make more money, he builds a factory and creates  jobs. In bad capitalist societies, he'll pay them a pittance (America) and they will be near broke and homeless. In Europe, the workers haji a comfortable life and now the CEO and his 30 new workers are happy. Now that 30th worker can decide he wants to get rich too and open a business with his new stable life.  Europe has done it all right imo, they accomplished the main social welfare part of socialism with the economic powerhouse of capitalism that another system simply cannot compare too (Economics wise).
Well then they should close shop and go to work elsewhere. If you're working harder and receiving less, then what's the point?  Because it's typically not true. Many many businesses claim they're losing money, so they can close up and declare a loss. How many times have you seen a place shut down, and then be open a week later with the same employees and products but a different name? They're working the system.  
[deleted]
lol okay. i'd call a man a corporate whore in the same context so please get the fuck out of here with your political correctness. it's really beside the point and you're making issues that distract from the topic at hand.
Bring it.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
The sunset provision meant it was dying already, ending cloture gave it a chance to live.   &gt;it is far more likely that all democrats voted to stop discussion because they can kill it  They are voting on it tomorrow. So we will see won't we :-)
"I'm from the government and I'm here to help you."
All true and correct, just as is the point of his piece.  The truth is often painful.
&gt; The decision had nothing to do with money or corporate influence.  That claim is wrong and dishonest.  The court declared that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, “do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption”; something that is obviously false to any observer of our political system.  In McCutcheon v. FEC, Roberts et al. went even further, prohibiting congress from passing laws that would rein in anything other than quid pro quo corruption.  In short, they barred laws that prevent "the appearance of corruption", and almost certain, but unproven, corruption.  They undid 100 years of anti-corruption laws so that the only way to be guilty now, is to accidentally write "bribe" in the memo field on the check.  These decisions have EVERYTHING to do with money and corporate influence.
You used the wrong term, someone tried to clarify and you flipped out. No one has said it is being implemented. It's amusing to watch you declare victory after proving the other guy right though.
So he's just letting it pass to make Rand Paul look bad?  What an ass-hat.
Professional mathematical analyses have concluded that Maryland's districts rank dead last among all states in geometric compactness (the squiggly-lines test).  And Maryland democrats also enjoy the greatest *over-representation* in the legislature as a percentage of the number of votes they receive of any state in the country.  [Sources](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37uhkr/martin_omalley_throws_his_hat_in_the_ring/crq12g5?context=3)  By all available statistical measures, Maryland is actually more gerrymandered than any Republican-controlled state.
Ok, look at top organizational contributors:  https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/toporgs.php  We have to get clear to number 10 before finding an organization that gave overwhelmingly more to repubs than dems.  I am not trying to defend Citizens United (I disagree with it and hope it is overturned) nor am I defending Republicans (I am not one and generally disagree with them as well).    I am trying to point out that the narrative of "Republican politicians are bought and paid for while Democrats are the little guys trying to fight the power" is total bullshit.

&gt; Owning your own US President has become the ultimate billionaire accessories.   First, what billionaire owns Obama, or Clinton, or Warren or Sanders, or Rubio or Bush or Rand Paul?   Can you be specific and list names?  &gt; The traitorous Citizens United Laws put forth by the Republican Supreme Court allows the GOP to sell all elected offices to the highest bidder.   This makes no sense at all. You are not presenting an argument that the decision was wrong. And i doubt you read the case if you think it was about money, i honestly also doubt you understand the judicial process if you think Justices propose or put forth a case.  Citizens United was a simple court case. The group CU wanted to publish a movie called: "Hillary The Movie" on the day of the IOWA primary. The BCFRA restricted 3rd party electioneering 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election. CU challenged the law claiming that restricting their ability to broadcast a movie was a first amendment violation.  The supreme court agreed, striking down that portion of the law and also striking down, Michigan v Chamber of Commerce.  The question to you or anyone who feels the way you do is, why do you think its okay for the government to restrict a groups freedom of speech simply because that speech is dealing with politics?   &gt; As such each billionaire wants to own their own President (billionaires are generally not very good at sharing). So the GOP is running people who are willing to sell themselves out to the highest bidder and thanks to decades of GOP/Right Wing policy the US has more of two things the ultra wealthy and the poor.  So can you name each billionaire and how much they bought each candidate for? or are you simply making assertions without evidence?  &gt; In the past the wealthy were satisfied owning sports teams and competing with their fellow millionaires and billionaires. Now Citizen United allows the to own their own politicians and compete with their fellow mega rich in GOP primaries.   Where did CU have anything do with money
Which is why rather few low income people live alone unless absolutely necessary.  Get a roommate or two to split the bills and its a lot more affordable.
Climate change denial is an act of bad faith. Let's live in the real, and shift out of fossil fuels that produce dangerous climate change which is already destroying life and property.  It is a business decision based on the-world-will-save-itself scenario. In that case, the world must constrain carbon emissions, even as it still uses some fossil fuels in the transition to a carbon-free future. Texas oil is cheap enough to get used, even if it must pay a carbon tax (set at a rate that assures carbon emissions are limited to a safe level). The alternative scenario is the-world-is-too-greedy-to-save-itself. In that case, climate destabilization will make rational economic planning futile. You can't even be sure that Texas will have refineries that are not under water or blown away by storms.
The vast majority
Well, there's a Springfield in New Jersey, so it may very well be.
You make a good point, but i would argue both are wrong about higher education. The college system is headed towards utter collapse regardless because no one can keep costs down and unions are selfishly demanding more money on the backs of student debt. The feminist movement is convincing people that women's studies is a lucrative major. At some point the cost will out weigh the demand and many many college will fold.  Go to cc and get a couple AAs instead. Learn to code while youre there and you'll have a job for life.
Not very many young black males in Canada. 
As I understand it, the concern in this thread is that **HR 2048 - USA FREEDOM ACT** will be voted on in the Senate tomorrow. This bill contains an extension to the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act allows for bulk data collection programs.   Many people in this thread are likely calling or writing in opposition of HR 2048. (That's really all you have to say if you choose to contact anybody. No need to write a novel.)    [https://www.opencongress.org/bill/hr2048-114/show](https://www.opencongress.org/bill/hr2048-114/show)   From the bill's official summary:  "(Sec. 705)  Amends the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to extend until December 15, 2019..."   
I know his politics, and I don't generally like them.  He has a few issues where he falls into the position of a broken clock that's right twice a day, but in general, his stances are outright disturbing.  He's opposed to mandatory vaccinations for children (which save many innocent lives), supports a 17% flat tax, wants a ban on all abortion with the exception of those performed for the life of the mother, etc.  Paul is an extremist, and while he may not be a war-monger, he's definitely homophobic and his ideas on race are problematic even if he doesn't intend for them to be.  His ideas regarding allowing states to make their decisions is a thinly veiled way of opposing same-sex marriage while still maintaining a pseudo-Libertarian image, and his statements about the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were seriously thought out, not just innocent gaffes.  This is not the sort of person who needs control of the White House.
I see, so she won't pick liberal supreme court justices to overturn the exact ruling OP references?  Realize that the phrase 'both parties are the same' is more simplistic than insightful.
Well your vision of how people get paid doesn't make much sense. It's a negotiation. People make more than the minimum working for me because they are worth it and they asked for it. I give raises every year in order to keep my employees from leaving for a better job. I can't afford to offer health insurance so I am particularly vulnerable to losing employees.  But the fact of the matter is I don't have many jobs worth over $15 an hour. I simply don't. Now if some kid, or anyone for that matter wanted to come to me and clean up, or sort hardware for 6 bucks an hour cash, I'd have about 10 of those jobs.  The work experience, the fact that they aren't playing nintendo/watching TV, and the overall increase in productivity for society as a whole would be a dramatic positive in my opinion. And no one HAS to work for 6 bucks. But some want to and you won't let them. Why? You know better what's good for them? I doubt it.  I'm here talking about consequences. You can be on a moral high horse all you want, but it doesn't change the numbers of my operation.
it certainly does not.  by the way "not infringed" does not mean "not restricted" in the legal sense. in case that is where you got confused.    
By your logic anyone who buys stock in Iconolatry Films, a corporation that produces Michael Moore's films, is fostering political corruption.  In regard to the actual suit though, can you tell me why the corporation that produces Michael Moore's films should be allowed to advertise those films but Citizens United should be denied that same right?
Labor coming together in protest for higher wages isn't the issue. The government forcibly requiring a business to pay them is. 
There's probably more black people in Detroit than the entirety of Canada. Take away black crime and the US has a crime level similar to Norway. 
&gt; The college system is headed towards utter collapse regardless because no one can keep costs down and unions are selfishly demanding more money on the backs of student debt.  Nope.  The college system has been continually cut for 40 years.  State governments used to pay for 68% of research university costs.  Now they pay for 6%?  And Louisiana is cutting another 2/3 of that?  This year?    Research universities provide current cutting-edge research to the current local and national economy and competitve advantage in the current world economy.  Cutting support means that all that advantage is now paid for on the backs of students. 
Absolutely.  So what sort of evidence do we have that Citizens United has resulted in a dollar imbalance that vastly favors Republicans?  I'm not opposed to the idea that this is true, just asking for some evidence.
Sorry but it just seems like you're being contrary for the sake of being contrary. The thing hasnt even been passed and you're making these all these mildly misleading claims just skirt just outside the edge of truth.  The USA Freedom act isnt just some extension of the Patriot act but, from what I've been reading, an attempt to scale back what the government does collect beyond their usual scattershot approach.  
&gt; Sorry buddy, but you shouldn't exist if you can't pay a living wage. That's bad for the economy.  It'll be interesting to see how all you armchair experts react when you get your wish and see hundreds of thousands of jobs eliminated that you deemed unworthy of existing by doubling their cost.    There are actual stores in San Francisco that are leading crowd-funding campaigns to stay in business after the min wage hike there.  These were stores that were loved by the community and around for decades, they just barely made it by, but they did and provided tremendous value to the community and its employees.  Not every place is going to go under, many will adapt by becoming automated.  I laugh when I think about my first job paying me $15/hour when I was in high school.  It's absurd, robots will do what I did for my first job, no doubt about it.    Doubling minimum wage just makes that happen faster and gives society less time to come up with a solution for what to do with unskilled labor who doesn't have a service worth buying anymore.  &gt; But you're also ignoring step 2, which is that demand and your sales will increase when everybody around gets paid more, so yes - you can afford to pay $15 an hour.  He sells discount cabinet hardware, you vastly overestimate the effect that our "newly wealthy" minimum wage earners are going to have on that market.    Why don't you try working or running a small business that basically just makes it by for a little bit and see how rude your comments seem.
And even in this tax cut, the wealthy got more.   Based on those numbers, poor people got a 34% tax cut, while top taxpayers got a 40% reduction.
Who were convicted. Fine. 
Unfortunately that slavery is rather detrimental to that person and society as a whole.
ill ask you the same things i asked OP  Citizens United was a simple court case. The group CU wanted to publish a movie called: "Hillary The Movie" on the day of the IOWA primary. The BCFRA restricted 3rd party electioneering 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election.

By all means, show some support for this allegation.  There was a trial, perhaps you could cite something from it?  Did Trayvon Martin call the cops?  Did he go home and retreat inside?
There is no reason to believe that his use of whore was due to being a woman  edit: People are incapable of understanding the point. Whore is a VERY popular term to call ANY politician when regarding financial sell outs, and unless you have *PROOF* from jcbmk8's history that implies his or her's malicious, sexist intent, you are essentially just projecting your assumptions onto jcbmk8.  edit 2: Made my comment less agressive
Yes our economic system is perfect and flawless. As such, the market accurately dictates the worth of everything and everyone based on their contribution to society.  Holy fuck where did you learn this nonsense?
Those are generally fundraising organizations that raise money from a variety of donars and then give them to candidatures, like "Act Blue"; those aren't the sources of finding.  There are some unions on there, but I don't have a problem with that either.  If you look at actual business groups and coronations, there is no doubt that they give more to Republicans then to Democrats, while labor groups and groups that fund raise for specific political causes (like environmental causes) give more to Democrats.  https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/blio.php
He's actually much better qualified for the job of president than Sanders is, having been in top level executive roles for more than a dozen years, vs being an undistinguished backbencher senator.  It's going to much easier for the average voter to see O'Malley in the commander-in-chief role than Sanders.
You do realize the word that normally follows illegal when referring to people coming here  to live through non lawful processes from another country is immigrants don't you?  Illegal immigrants and legal immigrants are both immigrants.  
Well up until the point that he violently attacked a stranger.
Do you know how stuff gets created and built?  A lot of hard work for minimal pay in exchange for the opportunity to grow and make more later on.  Even big companies started out small and the founders busted their ass to grow them.  America would never have gotten anywhere if people just gave up from the start.
But you make a distinction among degrees of developed life -- low and high -- regarding consciousness. Surely the woman in question is more developed along those lines than a fertilized egg. So shouldn't the woman be afforded more power over her own body?
The only thing I would change is Michael brown and instead put John Crawford.  
Value is inherent?  Ummm the entire field of Economics completely disagrees with you.
Yes. Now, please, give me something that he actually has power to control as POTUS.  He can't exactly wave a pen and eliminate gay marriage and abortion, "give" Social Security to Wall Street, and impose a flat tax.  That's completely outside his sphere of power. Congress decides on those issues. On the other hand, as POTUS, he can bring troops home, and end domestic spying.
That's an interesting way of thinking about it.
It does no such thing. It's laughable that science deniers and Global Warming Alarmists now want to blame floods on people who refuse to worship their god. 
A turnip has 46 chromosomes?  And when it matures it is capable of thought and motor skills?  
&gt; it's usually corporations giving large amounts of money  Corporations can't give money to candidates or campaigns.
Didn't I call her a whore for Wall Street? Aren't businesses on Wall Street corporations? So she's a corporate whore? Oh okay. I'll see you later. 
Theoetically, but in practice, Citizen's United makes all of that totally irrelevent.  Each candidate now has his own Super-Pac, which gets tons of money from corperations.  In theory, candidates aren't supposed to co-ordinate with them, but in practice, everyone ignores that.  Jeb Bush is currently delaying actually announcing his campaign simply so he can raise more money for his super-pac directly.   But even after a candidature announces, they can still participate in fund-raisers for their super-pac, they just can't literally ask people for money for it; it's all a pretty meaningless distinction at this point.  
&gt; While that is true, we are talking about overall numbers here. There are regional differences in lots of things, including crime rate, in any country on the planet.  Why do you think that is? Because there are many factors that influence the crime rate. That is why you can't just compare two countries and try to determine the influence of one factor in the crime rate without also accounting for all the others.  &gt;One could argue that Canada or Australia are very similar to the US in terms of culture, infrastructure and law yet there are big differences in crime rates between the countries.  And you could argue that Canada and Australia are very different in terms of population demographics, which is a main factor in the crime rate.
&gt;  Bit it's nothing compared to the Republican gerrymandered states.  That's just bullshit, there are plenty of links in this thread to prove that.  How bad is it? O'Malley and Mike Miller gerrymandered a district to get rid of one Democrat for another (Morello for VanHollen). MD politics is an absolute joke - think Louisiana or Arkansas but with some prep school assholes thrown in. 
do I hear crickets?
Meanwhile black on black murder skyrockets in Chicago and Baltimore. This is a silly article, I expect nothing less from the Washington post.
Because ignoring shit makes it go away.  Just like ignoring climate change is working out so well for Texas.
I think more importantly it ignores positive feed back loops in the economy. Particularly the problems associated with deflationary economies.
can you show me one person in this thread who is supporting him on this? Or are you just making up the fact that reddit still supports obama, then complaining about it for upvotes?
Don't disrupt the Atheistic Liberal Cricle-jerk here.
&gt; Further, delaying the bill's vote by a few days does virtually nothing to actually stop it  If the bill isn't voted on by Sunday, provisions of the Patriot Act *do* expire, including bulk collection of metadata by the NSA. 
"*Taxes are good*"  *Governmentisgood.com*  Hmm I wonder where this is going.
Yeah, it is tough to amend the Constitution. But a lot of people here seem to be under the impression the second amendment says "all citizens have the right to get whatever gun they want whenever they want without any inconveniences whatsoever," and that simply isn't what it says.   There's room for interpretation of what I means, and I don't think it does us any good to interpret it in the most certifiably insane way possible. 
You're very right in saying that. Honestly, I don't think either school (Keynesian or Austrian) of thought has yet emerged from the age of coin.  [Debt and taxation are completely unnecessary.](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E0D7103EEE3ABC4E53DFB467838A639EDE) In today's world, money is digits, numbers on your cell phone. As absurd as it is to say we need to go back to a gold standard, it is equally absurd that we need to raise debt and taxes to pay the government's expenditures.  Everybody is wrong on the money issue. Money is essentially the stock of a nation, and its value depends on the productive capacity of its People. Just look at Japan vs. Russia. Japan is the #2 economy in the world, but they don't have the vast land or natural resources that Russia has. By all means, Russia should be richer than Japan. But all Russia does is sell their resources, and government restricts competition and gives business to the oligarchs. Japan, on the other hand, has pro-business government and its people are extremely efficient and productive, so that their exports are goods that they created, and not something they dug up from the ground.
You easily can provide those things for that cost when making a profit isn't a concern. 
&gt; It's great that reddit is giving credit where credit is due, but let's call a spade a spade: Rand is a terrible candidate.  ok, lets see your reasoning why  &gt; Rand Paul is too close with the Kochs[1] .   What is wrong with that, they are two groups of people who share the same opinions on issues  &gt; He supports citizens united.   Ill ask you the same thing i ask people who present CU as being bad ruling.   Citizens United was a simple court case. The group CU wanted to publish a movie called: "Hillary The Movie" on the day of the IOWA primary. The BCFRA restricted 3rd party electioneering 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election. CU challenged the law claiming that restricting their ability to broadcast a movie was a first amendment violation.  The supreme court agreed, striking down that portion of the law and also striking down, Michigan v Chamber of Commerce.  **QUESTION:**  to you or anyone who feels the way you do is, why do you think its okay for the government to restrict a groups freedom of speech simply because that speech is dealing with politics?  &gt; He opposes Net Neutrality.   here i agree with you  &gt; He wants to give our Social Security to Wall Street.   now you are being disingenuous. he wants regular americans to have the option to invest for themselves. This is an option i would take in a heartbeat, considering i work in accounting and finanace. SS needs a fix as currently we have 100% funding but in 2030 that funding drops to 7% unless congress does something. I dont like putting my future in the hands of politicians  
"Bribery."  If you throw the word around enough times, people will start believing it. Even though there's no proof and it's a bunch of mights, maybes and could haves.  Must be election season.
Maybe,.. just maybe,.. the article **wants you to think**.  Wouldn't that be refreshing?
Yes, a woman is more developed biologically than the fetus.  But it's not just her body.  It's a unique situation where you have a separate organism that is living inside and dependent upon another organism.  Whether she should have the right to physically harm the other organism is a moral issue.    Should women be legally able to stay intoxicated and smoke while pregnant?  It's her body right?    What if someone intentionally kills a woman's fetus?  If that was my baby, I'm pretty sure I would feel as if my child was murdered.  
Black on black crime rates and problems with police brutality are related how exactly?

&gt;Martin never had any reason to believe Zimmerman was capable of killing him...  Yes, he did.  A stranger was following him in the dark.
&gt;You are incorrect  Whatever you say boss. He just doesn't have universal support, or anything even close to that. He's way, WAY behind Hillary in the polls, and that's just for democrats.   He just doesn't have wide ranging support, I don't understand how you could think he does. Either way, doesn't matter what either of us says here. But prepare to be sorely disappointed when he is out of the running in a few months. 
It's a poverty problem not a black problem. From your comment it seems as if you're implying that the problem of crime is a black problem so I apologize if that wasn't he implication.
Pretty strong grasp if you ask me m8, and the violence under the surge was far far less than Al Qaeda 2: ISIS Boogaloo.  Palin was incredibly stupid, so it must really sting to know even she was right about leaving Iraq while Obama got it wrong :\^)

Yep. What will happen probably is Kansas will raise taxes on poor people and then blame the whole economic failure on raising the taxes.
It appears his business does just fine and is competitive at this time.  It only becomes uncompetitive and a "failure" when you throw more crap on his back.

I don't find it all surprising that Global Warming Alarmists get insulted when confronted with the fact they deny science and have religious beliefs in their cause. I think it's better to have ideas than beliefs. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is harder. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit growth. It's very closed minded and anti-scientific.    Cognitive Dissidence. You funny. You didn't want to drop ad hominen, straw man, paradigm shift or some other intelligent sounding catch phrase you recently learned?
If he's not making enough to pay his employees a living wage, then no, he's neither fine nor competitive. 
This is a vote for cloture on a different bill. 
&gt; Citizens United produced a film. They were told by the government that they could not advertise their film due to its political nature.  When the right to vote conflicts with the rights of money in a dictatorship the rights of money win.  
Blacks are causing the police to show up to begin with. Animalistic behavior further isolates them.   That's what I think he meant anyway.
I never said I was going to vote for him. I simply think your arguments are invalid.  Each one of the ideas you think are "dumb" I think are good ideas that are at least worth looking at. A 90% top marginal tax rate would be two points lower than it was during the 50's. Keep in mind a marginal tax rate does not apply to all income just the portion above a certain level. So if someone makes over say 10 million in a single year I do think the top portion should be taxed very highly. I understand this is not popular and would never pass congress but that does not mean it is "dumb".   A $15 per hour minimum wage would not even get the average worker back to there they should be if worker pay had kept pace with executive pay and corporate earnings. It is a bottom starting point.  He does not want to nationalize healthcare delivery as some countries have done. He wants to nationalize health insurance with a single payer system. There is a very big difference between these two concepts.  So while I would not vote for him for many reasons I am glad he is running. His ideas are often good and will engage the debate in the Democratic primary on issues I think need to be discussed.
"If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there would be a shortage of sand" - Milton Friedman
&gt; The USA Freedom act isnt just some extension of the Patriot act but, from what I've been reading, an attempt to scale back what the government does collect beyond their usual scattershot approach.   * it extends parts of Section 215, parts that expire on June 1^st. * It expands bulk collection to include stuff like VoIP calls * It reauthorizes bulk collection, possibly requiring a second lawsuit to stop. *ACLU v. Clapper* took nearly two years before bulk collection was ruled illegal.  * It's opposed by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/congress-must-not-authorize-more-chilling-first-amendment-material-support-laws) * It's opposed by the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/patriot-acts-time)
It's not theft it you are receiving goods and services in return.  Have you read the article?  *Nice edit by the way.  Removing "I wonder what they want me to think" and replacing it with "I wonder where this is going".  Why did you do that?*
That's still disproportionately affecting the people making less vs. those making more.  The only fair tax is one that taxes higher earners at a higher percentage.

[Democratic billionaires outdo GOP in super PAC contributions...](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/democratic-billionaires-outdo-gop-in-super-pac-contributions/article/2555282)  People, Google is actually really easy to use to search this stuff.
&gt; plunged america into 3rd world status  Someone has never been to a 3rd world country. 
Ok, where do I find info on the big ticket funding?
&gt; No one has voted for or against bulk collection. The vote was for cloture. Meaning the people who voted for this are saying "let's stop talking about it and vote already."   Technically you are correct. In the practical world, **the vote for cloture is almost always the key vote.** If they can get 60 votes to evoke cloture, they can usually get 51 to pass the bill.  Sometimes Senators will try to lie to you and vote for cloture on the bill and then vote against the bill when it comes for a final vote. The bill passes anyway and they get to claim they opposed it. But it's total BS, and lobby groups like the ACLU and EFF usually **score on the vote for cloture**, not the final vote.
So if I steal 20% of your income, and convert the cash into services that I deem more necessary to you than whatever you would have normally spent that 20% on, it isn't theft?

&gt; The problem is that you can't cherry pick when it's okay for the government to violate your rights on a case by case basis based on what does good and what does bad.   It's never Ok.  But rights come into conflict.  And when they do, Republicans stand against the actual rights of the average every day citizen and favor those of the pink satin pants.  &gt;The governments power is very defined,   I don't have to accept the premise.  &gt;by violating rights in one case, you set a precedent to violate rights in another.  Which is exactly what Citizens United does.  It violates the right to vote at the most essential time of that right and thereby erases it.  Citizens United decides there really is no right to vote, no "one man one vote" no input from the powerless, no democracy - just dictatorship. Everything we hold dear, everything in the Declaration of Independence is lost under Citizens United which sets up the powerful, once again as rulers in the pink satin pants.  And worse, the pink satin then leverage their power to jerrymander away democracy.  It could be the worst kind of corruption this country has ever seen.  At least the worst since 1849.     
It's all good.  I was a Maryland voter at the time of its most recent redistricting, so I have done a lot of reading on it.  The Mother Jones graphic is actually pretty deceptive, because it buries Maryland at the bottom despite Maryland having the very highest ratio of over-representation.
&gt; so a single person would need an apartment costing $321.36 per month. Ridiculous!  If you're single, you have a bunch of options like roommates or parents, though.  What's the thinking behind renting a single-person apartment on a limited budget? "Hey, I have the awesome set of skills which qualifies me for all sorts of opportunities, time to go apartment shopping!"
Canadian here.. moved to the USA a couple of years ago. While I do totally get what youre saying about Canadians being frustrated with Harper, wishing to move to the USA isnt what you think it will be.   A few major differences between Canada and the USA make it not as charming as youd hope.   Medical Care: In Canada, its highly accessable, preventitve in nature, the system is relatively easy to navigate in terms of you arent well who do you see, what do you pay, who do you pay, what kind of care you can expect. There are standards that are relatively uniform nationally.    In the USA, its a cluster fuck of competitve lying business centered establishments when you go to get medical help. Everyone seems to lack basic knowledge, they never inform you of the information youd expect to get in Canada during a visit. The billing is always messed up. Nobody seems to keep track of what is going on with your billing. The bills are *massive*. The hospitals look incredible, tons of money poured into the building itself but when I broke my back the big huge beautiful building had ZERO blankets.   I waited for six hours with a broken back for an MRI to find out if I would be paralyzed with no blanket shivering in extreme pain... The bill was 7.5k to wait for hours with no blanket, get an MRI and promptly leave.  Politics: Canada has harper yep.. I hate him but.. USA has Bernie Sanders. Cant get a good canidate without the Canadian public participating in the political process. Having said that, still.. Canada is a champion of human rights issues. It is very subtle in how it plays out in every day society but when you live in the states and start to see all the isms of the corrupt anti socialistic republican agenda first hand you start to realize harpers Canada &gt; USA.  Examples like the education system here is really terrible. In Canada there are standards and we dont mean testing children 150 times before grade 6 either. Standards more like do you know basic science? Math? Reading?  Law: The law in the USA is so riddled with human rights violations its hard to accept as a Canadian. Its things like sending a young man to jail for 99 years for a few pot brownies, but letting convicted rapists and murderers, child abusers have light sentences like 2 years time in jail.   Propoganda: Canada has a news media that can actually include unbiased coverage of world events unfolding. The USA is like Russia with brainwashing garbage news. I have to watch Canadian news just to see what is really being said about events as they unfold. Not the view the billionare class wants me to know.  Random: When a nursing home - long term care facility shut down due to funding issues in Canada the residents are moved to another hospital no less would be right. When the same type of home shut down in Florida, the residents were literally left for dead. Two staff stayed on without pay to make sure the residents had food. Everyone just left them there to die.   Same thing with anyone who is suffering really the general attitude in the USA is often basically who gives a fuck, not my problem. Abandoned stray animals all over every city in horrible dire conditions, nobody bats an eye.  War vet with TBI and a missing limb? Well thats just another dirty beggar in the street.  A pastor wants to feed the poor? City threatens to take legal action against him, fuck the poor, fuck the homeless, fuck the weak,sick,injured,crippeled.   Wheres your wallet?   I miss Canada, even if its Harpers Canada.  Edit to thank kind stranger for the gold. Cheers, eh!

Global Warming Alarmism is a faith-based religion. It denies science and requires blind adherence to its tenets.

&gt;  More rich people with more money don't buy as many products as those minimum wage or near minimum wage workers would purchase.  While it's true that a rich person won't purchase 1,000 dollar-menu hamburgers or 100 beat-up used cars with half a million miles on them, a $1,000 restaurant meal or $100,000 cars are not unheard of.  &gt; If more people are buying products then demand goes up.  That is very consumption-focused. As European experience shows, consumption-oriented economies (Greece, Spain) are fragile even to tinier changes in macro economic environment, savings-oriented economies (Germany, UK) leave people with enough cushion to weather economic ups and downs.
They do not account for any externalities (human characteristics, cost of living, anything really...).   I cannot comprehend how someone could arrive at the conclusion that to eliminate the minimum wage would be a good thing in reality and have a positive effect on society.
sshhh...don't stop the circle jerk
The reason why businesses didn't flock to Kansas and Wisconsin after the state tax cuts are simple:  1. State taxes are a small part of total costs.  Even a substantial cut in income tax may be outweighed by an increase in freight cost for raw materials or finished products.  2. Business people know that these tax cuts are both politically and fiscally unsustainable.  They know it's not going to last, or the state will nickel and dime them to death elsewhere.
"And then I will force a MONEYBOMB!!!"
The elimination of the minimum wage would not guarantee low unemployment.  It would drive the cost of literally everything down base on whatever the majority of employers determined a 'fair' wage would be.  Do you believe large employers would not discuss this amongst themselves and agree upon a wage they would all stick to in a similar fashion to how the gas suppliers have colluded to ensure the price of gasoline stays relatively the same?

&gt; ill ask you the same things i asked OP  Also does this mean you accept the corruption of the Heritage Foundation, duck hunting with  Cheney, and booing at SOTU as the normal course of business?   I think we might just have had more educational strength in this nation under the horrible dictatorship of von Bizmark than we do under the Republican oligarchy and its corrupt justices.
&gt;Sure we can. It's called context.   No, you can't.  Context may imply, but that isn't knowing.  Unless you read minds you don't know the writers intention, you may guess at it or suspect it.  &gt;Such a silly generalization.   The only thing silly is your understanding of the language and the arguments you are making.  No, the **use** of language seeks to avoid ambiguity, the language itself is built upon it.  Take for instance pronouns.  Simple words than can be used to mean almost anything.  Pretty flexible.  Also pretty ambiguous if used poorly, or if the intention is to be ambiguous.  Another example, take for instance pretty much any word in the English language, they all have multiple meanings making their use ambiguous by itself.  Why multiple meanings?  To provide flexibility to the user of the language.  If words didn't have multiple meanings and pronouns didn't exist, the language would become unwieldy in size and dull in reading.  &gt;You cannot expect a set of words to have any meaning you want it to have. Yes, degrees of flexibility are possible but there are reasonable limits to such flexibility, otherwise it would breed confusion and miscommunication, defeating the purpose of language.  Then you should stop trying to.  You are the only one here who has claimed a set of words must mean one thing.  In fact, it is the reason for this entire discussion.  It does breed confusion, but people who understand the language understand that confusion can occur and ask the writer to clarify what they mean instead of the reader just deciding what the writer meant as you have done.  &gt;Nobody's saying the writer could have meant something else. He explicitly claimed later that he did mean something else. The issue at hand is whether the words he chose were appropriate for his intended meaning. And they weren't.  Yes they were appropriate as verified by my understanding exactly what they meant.  Weird, I read the same words you did and came to the correct conclusion.  You are suggesting your inability to correctly surmise the meaning of words that others have correctly surmised is somehow the fault of anyone but you?  &gt;The preexisting context was basically US politics. So the population in this context is the US population. And the fraction of the US population that thinks science and religion are in conflict is actually rather small. Small enough that the previous commenter's statement was a gross generalization, even if you cherry-pick just the evangelical population.  One, preexisting context doesn't actually matter if the writer doesn't intend it to.  Once again, you don't get to determine the writers intent.  Two, even if we take a your source at face value, the population includes 30% of the evangelicals which would still be millions of people. Three, your study only looks at evangelicals.  It is pretty dishonest to try and claim that evangelicals represent “the religious” when tens of millions of religious people aren't in fact evangelicals. Four, your source is talking about what people believe.  Do you want to really go on record as arguing that just because someone believes something it is therefore true or real. Fifth, your source is about “science and religion being in conflict”, neither I nor my “cntrl F” function found even a mention of climate change making your source irrelevant at best. Six, if someone believes X supersedes Y, that doesn't mean they have to view them as in conflict.  &gt;Context is US politics, and the US doesn't have billions of individuals.  You once again presume to know the intended context of others which is really irrelevant as replacing “billions” with “millions” matters not at all to the point being made.  But I get it, when everything else fails, go with semantics.  &gt;Generally true? You really don't know what you're talking about:....blah...blah...blah  More evidence you don't understand the English language very well.  I am not arguing the veracity of the OP's statement, I am arguing the veracity of your statement regarding the meaning of their language.  All of which ignores the simple fact that you have once again cited a source that is almost entirely irrelevant.    &gt;“Americans who report higher frequency of spiritual experiences ...”  Are at best a subset of “the religious” and may in fact include non-religious.  &gt;Depending on context they can be. Such as this one.   Nope, which is why I didn't need them.  &gt;And I already gave you a good example of another you appear to be desperate to ignore. If a cop is told “the hostages are dead” they're clearly not going to be under the impression that there were any survivors. Context matters. And context isn't as flexible as you seem to want it to be.  No, you gave a terrible example as it ignores one of the two real issues here.  The issues are language and generalities.  “the hostages” is almost always referring to a population size where generalities become impossible.   Generalities are based on statistics, which don't work well on a small population.  However, even if we use your example it is by no means a stretch to imagine the next words to be heard after “the hostages are dead” to be “All of them?”.  Meaning of course that even you simple example on a small population the language is ambiguous at best and the writer/speaker is the only one who can say for sure the intended meaning.  This would be even more true if “the hostages” referred to a group of individuals numbering in the hundreds of millions, like “the religious” does.  It has very little to do with flexible context, it has to do with you as the reader attempting to assign meaning to the ambiguous writing of another person.  The context can give you clues, but those clues assume the writer is operating under the same context as you.  Once again, you demonstrate a poor understanding of the language.  &gt;Actually I pointed out why your counter-example was useless to the larger argument.  No, you attempted to and in doing so contradicted yourself which is why I used that example.  &gt;In fact it's pretty much the exact opposite of an admission of wrongness.   No, your admission of wrongness has nothing at all to do with you being wrong.  All I can do is tell you you are wrong and show you, which I have done, I can't make you admit anything.  That is part of the reason you look so silly.  &gt;Your mistake lies with the fact that you refused to acknowledge that your example having 2 interpretations doesn't actually carry over analogously to the original comment about climate change and religion, despite me demonstrating as much.  You didn't demonstrate as much.  You provided an example that was less ambiguous, but mostly due to it being unequal to the original, ie the population of “the religious” allowing generalities to be effective vs the population of “the hostages” be far less likely to allow generalities.  And I repeat, “far less likely”.  So, really, either way, you own example proves you wrong as in both cases the language is ambiguous, while in your example, the context is less ambiguous.    The reason my example was also good, aside from getting to you to in your own words describe why you were wrong, it offers an exactly equal general descriptor of a large population and then postulates a generality about them and got you to admit via explanation that the example could in fact have multiple meanings which renders your assertion that the original language has one meaning in conflict.  You acknowledge that one is ambiguous and the meaning is dependent on the writer while trying to claim that isn't the case for the linguistically equivalent original.  &gt;You've just blindly assumed it must, effectively ignoring/not-comprehending what I wrote.   I did ignore it since I assumed you communicated it poorly as it disproved the larger point you were attempting to make.  It appears you didn't in fact miscommunicate it, you just failed to see the contradiction your own example provided.  &gt;How you could have allowed something so obvious to confuse you is incredible.  I became confused because I assumed you were actually smart enough to not prove yourself wrong with your own example and so assumed it was worded poorly.  I was wrong.   
Mind pointing it out?  Surely you can't be referring to the Politico article.  I'm looking for data, not a news article.

That must be why West Virginia (2nd poorest state in the country) has such an insane crime rate.  That would also explain why Prince George's County, with a majority minority population of 1 million people and also ranked as the wealthiest concentration of African Americans has a crime rate that matches DC itself and a violent crime rate that is about 20x that of the majority white counties just across the river. I believe PG is also considered one of the top 20-30 most affluent counties in the country as well, yet you can buy a mansion there for less than the cost of a 1 bedroom apartment across the river because no one is stupid enough to want to actually live there.    Keep telling yourself those lies and you might actually believe them.

The MJ graphic, if I view it correctly, implies it would take 5 Republican votes to equal 1 Democrat in the state which doesn't bear out. Even in a pro GOP redistricting article the author cites a 2 to 1 Dem advantage. That makes me wonder why bother fiddling with the lines? Other examples cited in this thread parties have juggled for an advantage, but in MD Dems already have a strong advantage.   http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/

Can he be impeached for this?
He has also muzzled scientists, preventing them from talking to the press. He blatantly ignores environmental issues in favour of making money. Majority of Canadians support more green policies, but they've been actively getting rid of or avoiding any sort of legislation to encourage business to minimize their impact.   Hugely reduced science budgets. They've dismantled the majority of our water research projects. They got rid of libraries across the country filled with scientific journals and testing information (in the case of water impact research some of the only records that even existed). All to save such a small amount of money as to be unnoticeable. And now private companies have taken these and will use studies paid for by our taxes and sell their findings back to the government.   He's not the worst person in the world, but I also don't think Harper is thinking past the next election, and a lot of his policies will end up costing us more in the future to make the current situation better knowing that it can't last. 
 The Patriot Act has no ground to stand on and yet the fear mongering has been constant, that if we don't keep the Patriot Act we will be putting ourselves in grave danger. Back in 2013 the NSA gave a weak statement to the Patriot Act's success, that it helped to prevent "only one or perhaps two" terrorist plots. Earlier this month a federal appeals ruled that the NSA's data collection is illegal. The FBI came out a week ago and admitted that it hadn't stopped a single plot.
Given the Paul Family's longstanding affiliations with White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates such as Jack Hunter (the self-dubbed "Southern Avenger" who co-authored a Tea Party book with Rand and thinks that "Lincoln was a Tyrant!!1!" and that John Wilkes Booth was a hero) I tremble to think what kind of Supreme Court Justices that Rand would appoint.  That's reason enough *alone* to completely discount Rand's candidacy.
&gt; Democratic billionaires outdo GOP in super PAC contributions...

The crowd here gets incredibly obsessive over the mainstream Democratic candidates when they are running for office - and if you can't see that you aren't paying attention.  The closer the election gets, the more you will see incredible coverage of the Democratic nominee in an overt way, with little to no negatives being shown.
And Wall Street gets its very own Democratic candidate.

The last chart in your first article shows that spending increased well before Citizens United and does not support your point with any post-Citizens United data.  Your second article does not highlight a clear trend, sorry, and to think that 4 years of statistics can shed light on any election trend is just silly.  You'd need a pre- and post- Citizens United comparison for that to work, and your two articles do not contain similar statistics, even though one is wholly pre- and the other wholly post-.

Do you have a study to cite for this statement. I don't see how raising minimum wage across the nation negatively affects the poorest people anywhere in said nation?
"Owning your own US President has become the ultimate billionaire accessories." . Left wing politically active billionaires Soros, Steyer, Lewis, Simons, Stryker, Eychaner, Zuckerberg, et al agree but were unavailable for comment.
Small companies are usually exempt from minimum wage laws.   The "think of the small business!" Bullshit needs to end. 
&gt; The ones paid by the Heritage Foundation  Evidence?   &gt; the ones who go duck hunting with Dick Cheney  Oh god that's like committing murder!  &gt; the ones who boo at SOU while Republicans jeer  I would like evidence on that one too.  
&gt; we're not in a mess. We still have the highest standard of living  Thanks Obama!
No, thats not correct.   If cloture fails the bill can be filibustered.  That's all.  Failing cloture does not mean that the bill wont pass, just like passing it does not mean the bill will pass.  
&gt;Part of the "security" of social security is it protects people from their own bad decisions,  In the land of the free, the home of the brave. 
"Well then they should close up shop and work elsewhere."  Let's try some role reversal here. When you talk about how expensive the place you live is, and someone replies with "Then just go somewhere else", and assuming you can just pack up your life and move, does that make you mad that they're simplifying the argument?  Because that's exactly what you're doing.
Those commissions didn't have the private emails.
&gt;"So instead of seeing paying taxes as analogous to being mugged by the government, we ought to think of these payments more like the tithing that many people do in their churches and synagogues.   The main problem with this central argument is that a church does not FORCE you to pay taxes.  If you wanted to make taxes an opt-out program just like tithing, then sure, no one would have a problem with that.  If your local church FORCED you to pay a tithing and hunted you down if you didn't, then well, you'd think your church was mugging you too.    The temptation to abuse this kind of power invariably occurs, and the revolt against that abuse of power is exactly what caused this country to be formed in the first place.  &gt;" But in practice, many religious organizations require members who can afford it to contribute regularly – payments that are really more like mandatory dues than purely voluntary donations.   This is hogwash.  Really...MANDATORY church tithing?  What if people don't tithe?  Is the church going to excommunicate them?
That's kind of a major part of how we track inflation. Inflation is the measure of relative buying power from one year to the next, factoring in most common purchases such as rent, common food stuffs, transportation, and common utilities.
Jack Hunter is not racist though. There are non-racists who consider Lincoln a tyrant.
I've never seen payment plans for a firearm but it wouldn't surprise me. Guns aren't that expensive but yes you could probably feed a family for a month for the price of one. You could (and many do) also use a gun to feed your family for a year through hunting. I dislike short-sighted measures that disadvantage the poor.
Ok OP, it's time to take the tin foil hat off.
&gt; Not in the chain in which you posted that reply.  This isn't a whole sentence.
I'm not sure what you and liberals want the cops to do? I have been taught all my life to respect cops because they have a license to kill. I'm not gonna grab at a cop because I want to live. Cops will shoot to kill, not shoot to stun. Blacks are less than 13 percent of the population and are responsible for more than half the murders and violent crime in the US. Cops have to deal with this fact.
It's hilarious that they have such blind support on reddit. 
So far you're the only one calling them zombies.
Knowing how little most social workers make, this doesn't surprise me. 
little known fact...in all death certificates of executed inmates in texas the cause of death is ALWAYS listed as HOMICIDE by state issued lethal injection. 
First, if you google minimum wage adjusted for inflation you get many sources that will put that number around $11, well above the current wage. I'm not saying it needs to be $15 but it certainly shouldn't be $7.25.   Second, I don't believe there's any better way to permanently stimulate the economy than to directly increase the purchasing power of almost 20% of the population and probably indirectly increase a significant percent of the rest of the population due to wage hikes to stay competitive.    Last, I don't think I need to cite a peer reviewed study (especially since you didn't for any of your counterpoints) for anyone to understand that more people with expendable income will inevitably increase overall demand. 
So what do you propose we do? Ban people from lying? What constitutes a lie? Is omission of data punishable? What about taking quotes out of context? What happens if there are multiple conflicting studies?  Maybe our government should set up an agency to decide what is and isn't truthful. We could call it the Department of Truth. Huh, now why does that name sound familiar?
Yes, it does
&gt; Also does this mean you accept the corruption of the Heritage Foundation, duck hunting with Cheney, and booing at SOTU as the normal course of business?  * which specific corruption of HF are you talking about? What did they do that was corrupt?  * does dick cheney go duck hunting with influential people  no i dont doubt that, if i remember correctly, it was a hunting accident that led to him shooting a friend in the face  * nd booing at SOTU as the normal course of business  can you be specific  &gt; I think we might just have had more educational strength in this nation under the horrible dictatorship of von Bizmark than we do under the Republican oligarchy and its corrupt justices.  um, ok? sure  so the republicans control education? Im sorry i really dont get the point you are making here or why you turn it into a partisan issue  but no im not interested in defending any political party 
&gt;Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and emblem of the Citizens United-era of campaign finance, spent gobs of money on the 2012 elections — more money than anyone else in American history.  http://www.propublica.org/article/how-much-did-sheldon-adelson-really-spend-on-campaign-2012  Why pretend no one noticed?  It makes no sense. 
Why do you think the number of individuals is more important than the total amount of money? Billionaires gave more money to Dems, period. That means that a *fewer* number of billionaires have **more concentrated** influence. Isn't that what you are against?  The Washington Examiner is merely reporting numbers from the FEC. Is the FEC an unreliable source?  Gee, math can be really biased sometimes.
I thought you were talking about keeping certain weapons out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them. Now it sounds like you are agreeing with me that the rule (such as bayonet mount) is simply meant to keep the weapon out of the hands of everyone. What am I missing here?
Still haven't answered either of the two questions I posed.

[Sure about that?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/)  Also, what does [this picture of Jack Hunter and his "Southern Avenger" outfit](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhKjH9pQno0/hqdefault.jpg) indicate to you?
I haven't seen that, no. I see more Sanders and Rand Paul cheer leading, while constantly dumping on mainstream people like Hillary or even Obama as being conservatives.
#RANDGROUND  I fully endorse this scause 
Why is there no need to make that argument?  Isn't that sort of the whole purpose of an economy?
&gt; Wall street is definitely not backing her.  idk. Goldman Sachs gave them half a million $ for 2 speeches.
Sales tax is 6.15% over there!? It's 25% here in Norway. Hello, welfare. 
I meant overall. Not everyone is a karma whore Mr judge 
He said, without a single shred of evidence. 
I just like to remind people about what the President's position really is in the grand scheme of things. He is the enforcer of the law, not the creator. SCOTUS appointments aside, a Republican House and/or Senate is the responsibility of PEOPLE of the 50 states.
As I mentioned before we have a different idea of what caused the split. If you think that gold helped keep productivity in line with wages, you can but your graph ignores the preWWII era where wages were very much lower than labor productivity (both the gilded age and bell epque  were under a gold standard). There just isn't a historic correlation to validate that claim. Whereas there is very good evidence that having control your monetary supply helps tremendously in times of economic downturn.  Rich bankers don't control the printing press. The US treasury does. The fed swaps assets for cash to add liquidity to markets. If anyone gets a free lunch in all this its the government. I dont see beurocrats as living large. Bankers are so rich because one of our political parties actively tries remove financial regulations and grow the ever widening capitol vs labor return rates.   Also we live in a consumer society, a little inflation is a good thing. We want to reward spending over saving. Spending (and investment, which is spending) is what generates economic growth. We absolutely do not want to incentivise people to sit on there money.   Most economists are paid through universities which are in no way funded through the fed.
I'm going to state the basic argument against increasing taxes:  1) Taxes pay for public goods...not every good is a public good.  Taxes that pay for things that are not public goods are wasteful and should not be.    The main criteria for a good being a public good is whether or not it's something the provision of which is critical to a polity's health, and whether or not the market fails to provide for it; without that failure, a good is not a public good.  Some typical market failures are poverty alleviation and security provision.  The private sector, where self-interest reigns, does not seek to provision for either since it's not profitable to do so for anyone.  There's no profit in poverty alleviation (the poor have no money!)...no profit in security provision (are YOU going to voluntarily join AND pay for the army?).  Both are critical market failures that if not solved can destroy any country, including this one.  So, our government taxes its citizens to ameliorate this concern and does not expect to profit from doing so.  2) Taxes create deadweight loss.  The private sector invariably is more efficient in any market economy in provisioning a private good.  Destroying a market economy and replacing it with a public sector risks creates enormous deadweight loss...in critical sectors like food, you get the Great Leap Forward and mass famine.  The government simply cannot gauge supply and demand by taking over the market function.  The market function is a private function.  Therefore, taxes are acceptable **up to a point**.  Exactly where this point is is up for debate, but the blanket mantra "government is good" is about as ridiculous as you can get and is a call for pure socialism, an economic system that every socialist economy in history has abandoned.  Note, the Scandinavians have a mixed economy just like ours and are not anywhere near to being purely socialist.
&gt; Still haven't answered either of the two questions I posed.  I see just one question and a latin phrase "*non sequitur*" that is outside of any question or statement.  I asked you what you meant:  &gt;&gt;If what you meant by "Non sequitur" was that you did one, you might want to make that more clear - like  &gt;&gt;"There's a non-sequitor for you.." or something like that. If what you meant was I had stated a non-sequitor, I stated that I disagreed.  So far I haven't heard what you meant.  All I see is a "0." And I have no idea what that is supposed to mean either.  
Yeah, he's just not PC.

If only the Examiner wasn't a right wing propaganda machine
His father ran a couple of very lucrative home improvement chains that eventually got purchased by larger chains and he learned retail and management from seeing how his fathers businesses ran the best. He would tell you point blank he didn't give a shit about you outside of work as long as it didn't negatively impact your ability to work. He would fire and hire on a whim, as well. But he knew that if you were constantly worried about money and your health, you would likely be distracted at work. That, in his opinion, cost him more than the amount he paid in wages and benefits. Everything was about making money, but not at the expense of the customer experience. A happy customer would tell friends and also be return customers at some point.   He was so uninterested in his employees personal life that he got mad that I was talking about my son with a customer. He asked me if I knew anything about him (the owner) other than work. I told him I didn't. He said that is because no one cares about other people. That was his one downfall in business. he didn't grasp the concept of building a relationship with the customer, even if it were only for the short time the customer was in the store. And he lacked empathy as well. He couldn't understand it when an employee was so upset about the death of a neighbor. He was all about business, but if it benefited the business, he would take care of the employee. 
If the Republicans were to control both houses, the only finger you can point is to the PEOPLE of the US who elected them.  Also, on foreign policy, I agree. He is not his father. But Clinton bombed Libya under the guise of "humanitarianism" which left a power void for ISIS to enter into. Actions like that would be reigned in by Rand, I would hope. 
Jindal is a Brown graduate and he says evolution is a lie. You KNOW he knows he's bullshitting people.
Only 2 Senate Democrats voted with McConnell and the Republicans to pass a short term full extention of the Patriot Act. [Here's the voting roll.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195)  90% of the Democrats in the Senate are on the right side of this, while only a handful of Republicans (Paul, Lee, Cruz &amp; Daines)
End the drug war. That's a pretty good way to do it. Of course, I would never expect the G.O.P. to do that. 
That's a long chain of assumptions from one simple comment.
Everywhere in Virginia except Richmond pretty much.
Except he really isn't leading or building coalitions. He is "leading" by making sure all the story is about him. Look at all his tweets, he talks about how it was **his** filibuster, despite the fact that it takes the support of 41 Senators to prevent a filibuster from being broken.  He didn't say "We will force the expiration of the Patriot Act"; He said "**I** will force the expiration of the Patriot Act", giving no credit to all the other Senators that need to go along with him to actually block the legislation.  By grabbing all the attention, he is just making it less likely that other Senators will join in blocking the surveillance provisions - after all, they aren't going to get any of the credit.
That's essentially what his dad did when he sold his companies. This guy bought a business that was 25+ years old and part of the city identity, so if anything he would sell it because it's such a well known company. It amazed me how many people I talked to after starting there that had purchased all their lighting from there instead of going with the big box stores. There were employess that came with the company that had been there for over 20 years, and when he bought it he brought a team of people that he had worked with for nearly that long already. In fact, the worst part of working there was that I was the only person there that wasn't part of one side or the other.
Taxes take money out of the economy and depress GDP. There's one exception, and that's for tax increases to pay down accumulated debt. (which is why the Clinton tax hikes didn't hurt the economy and may have helped at the margins)  http://www.nber.org/papers/w13264

Why the fuck do we need the federal government to spend money on this?
Actually, the data out of Utah proves pretty conclusively that when you give people housing, they are *much more likely* to then get jobs, work, and be productive.   When a person is homeless, they have a really hard time finding a job, but if they have a place to sleep and a permanent address, it gets a lot easier, and they're much more likely to work.

There is plenty of evidence that disproves the catastrophic global warming idea but you Alarmists deny it and seek to squelch real science. Why do you deny science?  And I've not insulted anyone. 
We could get all that for a fraction of what we pay in tax now.
Exactly, that's why the data is not from them, but the FEC.
Is this strictly state law?   I cannot imagine this would strand with federal law.
Go back to /r/conspiracy, bud. 
Did you read what I wrote?   I said that candidates say they don't have a litmus test, and instead rely on various code words.  Where in that paragraph does he say he has a litmus test?  To the contrary, he expressly said he didn't:  &gt;We don't have a litmus test for appointing judges--asking them if they're pro-life or not pro-life.  http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Mitt_Romney_Abortion.htm  Try reading closely in the future.
&gt; The root problem is attempting to build a currency zone around an area that doesn't have labor mobility. In the US different economic conditions in various States can handle one interest rate because workers can easily move between States and follow the work. That isn't possible for most workers in the Eurozone.   It's more difficult than in the states, but there's still a fair amount of labour movement around the EU. I think the larger problem is that the EU government isn't the kind of strong federal entity that the US has, and isn't able (or at least, *doesn't*) move money around on the same scale - we have rich states and poor states required to operate under the same monetary policy, but with no real attempt to equalise their differences through fiscal policy.   But if they tried, Germans would cry foul about having to subsidise the Greeks (the extent to which they already do subsidise them causes enough trouble), because those national identities are (for now) still much stronger than any feeling of shared European identity. Conversely in the USA... I guess there's *some* grumbling about certain states paying more and receiving less and effectively subsiding the others, but in the end you all tend to identify as American more strongly than as "yourstate-ian" so it's not enough of a grumble to prevent it from happening.
Well, after you've done off with all the spoils you do have to do a lot to fill the gaps with all the stuff you've already taken for yourselves. Time to bring stuff back to normal and prep the scene for the next game.   Kansas taxpayers get to pay for that. Hopefully the morons who voted for these kinds of disgusting, ignorant, selfish, mean-spirited and delusional policies might have learned a lesson, even if it's at great expense. Although I won't hold my breath.   Maybe Kansas should think better of their neighbors and understand that raising the average Kansas resident's quality of life is how you make the state better for everyone. A free for all arena only serves sociopaths who care about no one. 
  Free speech?So the guy with the most money has lots of speech. Corporations have speech. The people not so much. How can anyone see that as a victory of free speech?
[deleted]
People seem to generally not understand the difference between independent expenditures and campaign contributions. That the government needs a compelling state interest that is narrowly tailored if it wants to encroach on a fundamental liberty, such as talking about political issues before an election. And that the quid pro quo corruption interest justified contribution limits, but did not justify banning independent expenditures from corporate and union general treasury funds 60 days prior to an election.  If you believe the First Amendment means something, especially in the area of political speech, then I think Kennedy's opinion is a great victory. More speech is the better answer than restricting some speech. The First Amendment protects both the poor and the wealthy, it doesn't discriminate based on income.  I don't understand the comments that say this disenfranchises voters. The thinking there appears to assume that voters are just robots that vote for whoever spent more money on an election. But, spending on campaigns usually has diminishing returns. Additionally, a conservative voters decision to vote Republican could just as easily come *before* any ads that encourage them to vote Republican. Blaming the people spending money on the ads seems like a misplaced anger, anger that is actually at those who vote for the opposite party as you. That if it weren't for money and political ads everyone would suddenly be a liberal progressive?  Kennedy's opinion empowered people to talk about politics. Just like is being done in this thread. A thread that people access from electronic devices they bought with money. Those without the money to buy a computer or smartphone and an internet connection can therefore not take part in this conversation. Is that fair? Does that mean that I cannot talk about politics because I have the funds to own a smartphone and a wireless plan with data? My political message clearly reaches a broader audience than the poor person without internet access. But, that doesn't necessarily mean anyone that hears my message will change their minds. In fact, given the comments in here, people's minds are already made up on everything. But if that's true, then $10 million in ads arguing the other side isn't going to change their minds either. So, then the money being spent doesn't have an effect of your vote...and people are just voting for who they think is the better candidate.  Or maybe the assumption is that every voter is stupid and is being persuaded by ads to vote against their actual beliefs. Well every voter *except for the one making the claim,* since they clearly believe they are the one exception who isn't persuaded by ads. The flaw here is every voter thinks everyone but them is being persuaded, which in the aggregate means no one thinks they themselves are being influenced??
It's happening everywhere, it's not a secret. Mostly drug offenses.
The Constitutional concept of checks and balances is considered a racist, old fashioned idea on /r/politics....until a conservative is President.
Cops do not have a licence to kill.  They have the ability to use deadly force in VERY STRICT CIRCUMSTANCES and any time they do those circumstance should be put under a high level of scrutiny with one of the criteria being could they have used less force.  A cop can not just walk up and shoot someone in the head, which is a license to kill.    Second point while a true statistic it doesn't give full context.  You find more crime in poor economic areas.  Blacks in this country have had the system stacked against them economically through out history.  Slavery, the reconstruction, Jim Crow Laws.  And while it goes against the whole America dream thing, being born to a poor, uneducated parent creates a huge hole to climb out of to raise your economic standing.  For everyone bright shiny happy story of someone doing that you could find 10 people who were just as smart/clever but couldn't due to circumstances not just hitting right.  
We're fast becoming the "land of the safe and the home of the timid"  Edit: Saw you made a similar statement below. I like you.
Oh, so you're telling me that valuable people will be fired before the people who add very little or nothing?  Why don't you tell me more about your PhD in Bernie Sanders Economics?
&gt; Part of the "security" of social security is it protects people from their own bad decisions  And the war on drugs protects people from their own bad decisions as well. This is America, not preschool
The point is that there is a huge double-standard in the media. Things that are huge scandals when the Clintons do them are barely even talked about when other politicians engage in the same behaviors.
You have to pass it to know what's in it... Surprised we haven't heard this from Pelosi yet
It's both.  Martin was justified in defending himself from a stranger following him in the dark.  Then after they started fighting, he had reasonable cause to use lethal force.
It might be time to resurrect the unions.
&gt;&gt; It's never Ok. But rights come into conflict. And when they do, Republicans stand against the actual rights of the average every day citizen and favor those of the pink satin pants.  &gt; That's not just Republicans. That's most of your long time politicians in the pocket of big business.  The Heritage Foundation, the guy who sneers during SOTU and the guy who goes duck hunting with Cheney.  If any one of them was a real American who believed in the principles on which the Constitution was founded, we wouldn't have this problem.  &gt;&gt;I don't have to accept the premise.  &gt;You kind of do.    Nope. Government is what we decide it is.  &gt;The government has a strict set of rules in the Constitution.  There is no "the" government.  There is the US government and the Constitution identifies human rights.   There are not 1,300 sentences and phrases that identify what it says.   And there is certainly no slippery statement that equates money and speech anywhere in the Constitution, or that says the rights of a free people can exist when their particular rights are "overruled" by money interest.  That isn't in the Constitution.  If it is, quote it.  &gt;How it is interpreted can vary,  Contradicting oneself doesn't emphasize or deliniate the reasons for the government of a free people.   &gt;CU doesn't violate anyone's right to vote.  Clearly it does.   &gt;Everyone has an independent choice over who they want to vote for.  There are cynical people who claim that there is no choice. And other cynical people who strongly believe that their money influences choice.    And I think the 2nd group are correct which is why I have always respected the decision of the State of New York to not place undue influence on voters.    CU is all about magnifying that influence and nothing in CU is about giving people more choice.  &gt; It may put more power of influence with people with more money, and that isn't right, but that's an indirect effect of the law,   Given the power and influence of those who have been able to receive the decision  I can not agree its any thing but the desired, direct effect.   The indirect effect is additional gerrymandering that has further subverted the "choice" of the people of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, and other places.      
Unless you want to get anything done. 
What happened on the ground that gave Martin reason to believe Zimmerman could kill him? Zimmerman never had a disparity of force, as far as Martin knew, until the gun came out, which seems to have been after Martin began using lethal force, and so couldn't have given Martin a reason to use lethal force in the first place.
Or Joseph Smith. 
No, you don't, and you don't even understand the original quote.
How so?
Do you think we should restrict violent, mentally ill people from buying a bazooka? If the answer is yes, then you are okay with what you claim to be an unconstitutional restriction on a citizen's rights to own arms. If the answer is no, then you are okay with *some* restrictions, in which case you can stop basing your argument on your claim that *all* restrictions are unconstitutional.   Assuming your answer is no, it means you're okay with what you deem to be reasonable limits, *that* is all I'm arguing. There's nothing wrong with having some reasonable limits. After that, it's a matter of arguing what is and isn't reasonable, but stop pretending you aren't okay with *any* restrictions. 
I'll defend the *Citizens United* decision if anyone is actually interested. It was indeed the correct decision, probably one of the more important ones of the last decade.
Walmart actually encourages their workers to get welfare benefits and SNAP (formerly food stamps.) Source: I used to be a Walmart employee. 
And you think the fact that they lie about having a litmus test is better than a politician being honest about it?
He is a right wing libertarian conservative, the majority of r/politics is liberal democrats and socialists, the two fundamentally disagree on most major issues (Patriot Act they agree). The fundamental basis for each political views are so strong no matter how good and qualified he is you won't be a supporter.  My views are closer to Rand's and I think he's my preferred one in this field. He's only a terrible candidate if you have contradictory political views, which not all people do.
It was activist judges who made the situation by overturning laws passed by Congress and signed by the President.  She is trying to get rid of that activism. She is trying to overturn a judicial ruling from within the judicial system. Judicial activism generally involves Judges/Justices overturning laws, not previous rulings by the same court.
Obama sounds like a slightly more articulate Bush II in this article.
Foreign countries do too ala Hillary Clinton. 
Media companies have always had that megaphone and use it to endorse candidates, this just levels the playing field. Money is not evil, it's not anything just goods and services.
The war on drugs is unconstitutional. Social security is a tax. It is not unconstitutional.
Oh, some of those are scams? Thanks for telling me, I'm still about 20 rejection letters away from going down that path. 
&gt; Here's a black kid, 12 years old, playing with a toy gun in a public park. Cops come up and shoot him on sight:  The Tamir Rice thing is blown out of proportion. You can't be pointing a believable gun at people and expect no one to over react. Why is no one mentioning his shitty parents?   Why does no one note that Garner was committing a real crime but refusing to cooperate?  Why do they not care that Michael Brown had just robbed a convenience store, was walking in the road, then tried to run away and possibly punched the cop?  There are real victims out there, maybe put up a real victim? Not some fucktard who answers to their stupidity with more violence.
I actually think it's a good thing if they're open about this stuff.  That doesn't change the fact that the above commenter has zero reading comprehension ability.
I don't see Sanders building any anti-patriot act coalitions, nor do I see him participating in this one. Talk is cheap, so is voting
Yeah I wanted to be a trucker for a long time, mostly cuz I love seeing new places but I heard the money is also pretty sweet, then I fucked up in my early 20s and got a DUI.
As far as I'm concerned there is no difference between Republican and Democrat once they get into office. Both parties suck the corporate cock.
&gt;Your bolded conclusion is accurate.  I know, thanks.  &gt;The racist Martin physically attacked the smaller, weaker, slower fatter, Zimmerman for being a "Creepy Ass Cracker" "rapist" who got out of his car.  1) Martin is not racist.  2) Shorter does not mean smaller or weaker.  Manny Pacquio is 5' 5" and has beaten people taller than him.  3) Even if Zimmerman was all of those things, it doesn't mean he doesn't represent a physical threat.  4) Martin did not attack Zimmerman, he was defending himself against him.    5) He wasn't defending himself from Zimmerman because he got out of his car, he was defending himself from Zimmerman because he was following him home in the dark.  &gt;At no point before Martin's unprovoked attack did Zimmerman pose any physical threat to the larger, faster, stronger Martin.  Sure he did.  He was following him home in the dark.  
That's not what happened, in 2012 everyone got a voice. It doesn't take big bucks to be heard if you have something important to say. Also campaign advertising has little to do with the outcome of an election, popular candidates receive more funding because they're popular.
Seventh thing to know about O'Malley:  - His platform will follow Bernie Sanders but with toned down rhetoric and blow dried hair and more makeup until it is time to tack hard right again with zero tolerance, tough on crime stances. Unless he gets a VP offer from Clinton, which is what he is really after.
I'm not going to disagree with your argument about the appointment of judges. That is a valid argument.  I have read the constitution, though, and since we were specifically talking about how the President "can't exactly wave a pen and eliminate gay marriage and abortion, "give" Social Security to Wall Street, and impose a flat tax" the Constitution agrees on that point.
11k is just a hair less than I pay every year for my 2300sqft 4 bedroom/2 bath HOME here in Utah. I paid less than half that in rent for a 1000sqft 2 bedroom/1 bath prior to buying. OP is clueless.
Regrettably I'm not.. She had a second secret email account on a separate private server whilst serving as Secretary of State. And that's a fact, easy to check out. Nothing mass-media likes to share very often. For obvious reasons. 
Somebody just took their first civics class.
Wouldn't your logic also apply to people going to prison on purpose then for the free room and board? I never understood how this argument holds much water.  And, let's face it, that hasn't seemed to stop the obscene rash of tax breaks and deductions that are unquestionably being exploited, but nobody seems to care about that.. We're all much more concerned with someone who has almost nothing _maybe_ taking advantage of free housing.
It's really a libertarian vs. authoritarian issue.   You shouldn't expect the Republican Party to stick with its traditional positions, because the Old Guard is dying off and the young republican lean libertarian. 
I know you don't see it, because the media isn't talking about it.  Here's him joining in the filibuster to block the Patriot Act from being extended:  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195  Here's him voting against the extension of the Patriot Act in 2011:  http://www.opencongress.org/vote/2011/s/84  Here's him voting against the 2008 FISA Expansions of these programs:  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00168  Here's him voting against the 2007 Protect America Act that expanded these programs:  https://www.opencongress.org/vote/2007/s/309  Here's him voting against the original Patriot Act less than 1 month after 9/11:  http://educate-yourself.org/cn/patriotact20012006senatevote.shtml  If you get your news from the media, then yes you wouldn't know all that because they don't bother to mention any of it. If you have been actually following the votes on these programs since 2001, then it is quite clear.
Whoa there! If we start linking up money to saving the most lives, then we might end up with a social contract!
Social Security tax is about as regressive as it gets, the Kochs arent that bad and aren't really fond of Rand anyway, Businesses should be able to discriminate in a free country, inner cities have been run by liberals for 50 years and are shitholes, hes against corporatism, hes opposed to federal marriage regulation.    Abortion is no more a reproductive right than it is a right for a man to rape a woman, so buzzword yourself away to your Elizabeth "affirmative action" Warren forums.
&gt;Why should the corporation producing Michael Moore's films be allowed to advertise them and Citizens United be denied that same right?  Not what its about. What it is about are 300 million disenfranchised Americans who are faced with a few rich billionaires who don't even know what they want or why they want it. 
Sooo, I'm supposed to vote for a guy because even though he wants disastrously harmful social and economic policies he probably can't make them happen?  No thanks. 
Yes, of course the Clinton Foundation has had some real charitable projects with the 15% that they don't spend on themselves.  These donors did'nt then know what they now know.
Even if Romney didn't use the phrase "litmus test", it is extremely clear that he would be using one from the statement that was given:  &gt;Today, we recommit ourselves to reversing that decision [Roe v. Wade]  You quoted other times when he said "We don't have a litmus test", but that doesn't erase his other statements that made his position quite clear.
Technically you are correct. In the practical world, the vote for cloture is **almost always** the key vote.  If they can get 60 votes to evoke cloture, they can usually get 51 to pass the bill.  Sometimes Senators will try to trick supporters and vote for cloture on the bill and then **vote against the bill** when it comes for a final vote. The bill passes anyway and they get to claim they opposed it. But that's total BS, and lobby groups like the ACLU and EFF usually score on the vote for cloture, not the final vote.
Perfect, a claim with no data to substantiate. Good job.
One president and a bushel of senators standing in the way of Freedom.
god you liberal fucktards are insufferable 
I don't think much money is spent on saying something and doing nothing. 
Disagree. He's made it quite clear he's not racist. You're quite a cynic.
I still don't really see what you're point is. Why do you think a homicide being classified as a homicide warrants mention as you're doing? 
Paul has never shown any intolerance towards others, so no he is not a bigot.
When are we going to stop holding GOP candidates' feet to the fire on climate change issues? Most of them are intelligent, serious, and committed politicians. It is not that they do not understand the science behind climate change - they choose to ridicule it because it means they get support from fossil fuel industries, and it fits the narrative they feed the rubes of the USA who are more concerned about gassing up their 350 than anything else ('cept guns, God etc). My dog, Fido, has been told numerous times to stop mooching at the dinner table. But he keeps doing if allowed - cuz he's a dog. Dogs ain't got no humanity, much as we would like to think they do.
Dude, please don't let the "Rand Paul is Crazy" brigade bait you into this crap. Their whole thing is to misdirect you from Rand Paul actually doing something AMAZING that no one else in politics has the character to. Just don't engage these folks.
Then you're not paying attention.
That is untrue, just as was your first post.
&gt; Ryan D. Hall, who started his own radiology company in central Kansas last year, said he was not receiving the exemption because all of the money his limited-liability company earned was counted as wages, and the exemption applies only to non-wage income.   So their tax cuts the benefit "small business" don't actually benefit small businesses. 
&gt;If it had increased steadily, as prices did, minimum wage would be about $15 already.  Adjusted for inflation (prices) it's never been over $8.54  &gt;If more people are buying products then demand goes up. If demand goes up, employers will find a way to meet that demand, i.e. hire more employees.  Except raising the minimum wage doesn't create any new money, it just re-distributes it. Companies adjust by cutting elsewhere, that might be in investments which are money multipliers.  No company has a Scrooge McDuck-esque vault that they can reluctantly dig from to pay workers more, more money to unskilled workers is less money to somewhere else.
&gt;using the word problematic in a serious manner.  Instantly stopped reading.
I'm not the one who made the comment. Again, who is "we?" Speak for yourself, not for everyone else on reddit.

"There are different kinds of truths for different kinds of people. There are truths appropriate for children; truths that are appropriate for students; truths that are appropriate for educated adults; and truths that are appropriate for highly educated adults, and the notion that there should be one set of truths available to everyone is a modern democratic fallacy. It doesn't work."  -- The Godfather of Neoconservatism

You're wrong. That's exactly what is was about. CU brought suit because they were denied their right to free speech. If you want to get money out of politics go to congress but this case was a victory for all.  And why can't you answer the question?m 
[deleted]
I did..._I_ got the same results in Chrome and in Aurora and they weren't what the article was trying to say
Lol yeah because that happens all the time. Check out the national statistics and get back to me.
The fact that they use PAC's is to hide the original source of money and the point was to refute the fact that Democrats have more of this dirty money.   The $50.00 you or I might contribute is going to get your or I nothing. Sheldon Adelson's $150M contribution gets him anything he wants. It is that simple.
ACLU's position is a little more nuanced. Conservatives oppose anything that would level the playing field for non-billionaires and staunchly oppose all disclosures.  Most non-palm palm cheering internet activists do not have an issue with what CU did as far as speech itself, only what it did as far as disclosure and equal opportunity.  &gt; At the same time, we recognize that the escalating cost of political campaigns may make it more difficult for some views to be heard, and that access to money often plays a significant role in determining who runs for office and who is elected.  &gt; In our view, the answer to that problem is to expand, not limit, the resources available for political advocacy. Thus, the ACLU supports a comprehensive and meaningful system of public financing that would help create a level playing field for every qualified candidate. We support carefully drawn disclosure rules. We support reasonable limits on campaign contributions and we support stricter enforcement of existing bans on coordination between candidates and super PACs.
Couldn't another filibusterer be called? So that this thing would lapse. 
Money is not speech. Money spent in the promotion or due exercise of an action is protected and punished as that action. Money spent in the promotion of an illegal act is also illegal. Money used in the promotion or due exercise of free speech is protected as that speech itself  Secondly, speech is a negative right, you have the right to speak, not the right to be heard  Nobody has more or less speech than anyone else. Some people are just heard more than others 
Ah, I see.  I'll need to do more research.  I do know elections have been getting less and less competitive since the 70's (Southern Realignment).  If we're seeing the trend slow down, I suspect it's rather bottoming out than anything related to Citizens United (for the logic stated above).
DAE bernie is literally stalin????
Care to elaborate?
In no way am I attempting to dis you, but I don’t know how many times you intend to post this.  A great time to learn about work rules and expectations is in the interview process.    If you can cook food people want to eat you have a lot of options.
Ah, I see, gotcha. Still I would prefer to see Sanders a bit more involved in Rand's current efforts. I realize he and Paul are competing, so maybe there's that. Perhaps he offered to help Paul and was declined since Sanders is seen as a bit extremist in conservative circles and his association may hurt Paul's chances. Or maybe Sanders is just old and needs to get to bed early.
Ok, so your problem is with the FEC, not the Examiner.  FYI, to disprove something you have to provide more than just, "That is untrue".
Exactly, you entered the job market when it was still strong, when wages for entry positions were higher, when people were still optimistic. People go graduated after 2008/9 have had a completely different experience, I promise you.
It's the third time I've posted it, the first two were taken down because of technicalities.  That is not the point. Yes I can go elsewhere where company policy is to give breaks, but that only changes my own circumstances.

He needs to have the 10 killed to show Republicans how pro life he is. Republicans and consistency, not exactly compatible. 
So, her people must have told her Bernie is getting a great response from that one.
When Czar Nicholas was in charge Rand's family was the rich class. They got deposed like all the aristocrats when the proletariat began killing the bourgeois for the exact conditions she described in that terrible book.
Could you point me to these Citizens United Laws passed by the Supreme Court? I'm having trouble finding them. 
There are people who already exploit the current system to land themselves in jail for a free meal and place to sleep.  And it's not being the devils advocate when the assumption you are making is  wrong.  This program, even if exploited by people (it will be) will still cost less than just throwing people in jail.

Can you please explain how Citizens United violated my right to vote? Last I checked, I still voted in the last election. 
Right, they should turn white and get jobs on Wallstreet. Then they could steal billions and get away Scott free.
And if he were alive today to see [a liar and war criminal like Benjamin Netanyahu receive 29 standing ovations by every single member of Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KMVhb57RqI), then I'm sure he would feel vindicated for that statement.  He was a hateful racist and a truly despicable person, but on this one issue he was not wrong.
Hang um high Ricketts!
The more I learn about Hillary, the more I would rather have like Ben Carson as President. But really, the President is just a puppet nowadays. They take orders from the banks and the Fed and the weapons manufacturers. It's a sad truth.  Unless Bernie comes in. I'm praying, but I still think he'll find it hard to implement his agenda. There's no profit in funding education. There's no profit in taking care of old people. Our government is here to create a profit for the corporations so the stock market continues to be inflated. 
Well, except Hilary actually released all of her work-related e-mails.   
I wonder if it's frustrating to travel to the ass end of the planet to fight for freedom only to be oppressed by the people you consider to be your team.   That shit would irk me
TIL comprehension is weird.
Your information was incorrect as was the Examiner as I pointed out in my response.   Here is what you posted: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/democratic-billionaires-outdo-gop-in-super-pac-contributions/article/2555282  It is factually wrong.

What does a bunch of white and Mexican bikers have to do with police brutality again ?
Judging by your post, I'd say you have a firm grasp of both American jurisprudence as well as reality.  Keep up the good work, fellow traveler.
&gt; Part of the "security" of social security is it protects people from their own bad decisions, and it protects me from someone else's bad decisions, be it the person in charge of my social security investing portfolio, or the guy who blew his and now needs more assistance.  There's two problems with this:  1. It's effectively a pyramid scheme. It only functions when you have enough new tax payers to feed the number of retired persons. As more and more people retire, the system chokes and becomes a liability.  2. Some people don't *want* protection from "bad decisions".  There's no opt-out. There's no, "I don't want to pay into it or take out of it". It's mandated. And not everyone is going to agree. And then add into it the number of people who aren't even working yet, especially the young, and you're looking at an impending disaster. The way it's structured is flawed, and the mandated payment is likewise a flaw.

No one is figuring in the cost of repairs to the fucked up housing?  ......Seriously?
&gt; Also, please explain how raising the federal minimum wage hurts the poorest in any community?  * Firms are assumed to be profit-maximizing and individuals are assumed to be utility-maximizing. So individuals want to earn as much money as possible (positive supply curve) and firms want to pay as little as possible for a specific labor (negative demand curve). What happens is that firms hire and keep hiring as long as the next employee they hire has a marginal benefit greater than the marginal cost to employ them. When a price floor is instituted, some employees will have a marginal benefit lower than that new minimum wage. Now the marginal cost is greater than the marginal benefit and because firms are profit-maximizing, those employees will be fired or not hired. Which sort of employees will have the lowest marginal benefit to their employers? Those that have the least skills and experience, which are the poor and lower class.  If that isn't perfectly clear, here are some videos that may explain it better than text.  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjD23OcVJvk * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct1Moeaa-W8 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQj1qlsjVoM
I could copy and paste several other dissenting opinions for other court cases, but at the end of the day: it was ruled the way it was ruled.  Go complain to John McCain, Russ Feingold and the man who pulled their strings - George Soros - to get campaign finance reform to keep the advantage with the incumbent.  Get over it.
I actually have very little of an opinion on social security. I just like arguing
Well, except that (a)Hillary is who decided what was to be released, and I'd say it's fair to assume there is reasonable doubt about whether everything was released (if the roles were different and we were talking about condi rice's or rumsfeld's email, would you take her/his word for it?) and (b) according to the article, LA law does not require him to release his emails.
&gt;PR move  What makes you say that? It's not like he's running for re-election. He doesn't need good public relations at this point, he can tell America to wipe his ass, and everybody will collectively bitch as virtually nothing in his life changes.
You are still confusing *number of billionaire* donors with the *total donation amount*, which is the bottom line. Dem billionaires donated more. You have not refuted that, but instead argued a separate (and irrelevant) point.
&gt;So, you think, people reach 65, they don't have enough to retire, but they lose their jobs...fuck em? Right?   No, but I don't think we need to make them wards of the government.   &gt;You don't evaluate the utility and necessity of programs like Social Security based on some pithy and childish saying.   There is nothing childish about freedom, and the courage to embrace it.
Well then, perhaps you can clear up *my* confusion: you appear to be asking a person why they allow a feature to be shown, when that person has no control over whether that feature is shown. Why?
They live inside a body that could find itself in the scenario. Empathy is wonderful and I know first hand how much men can be pro choice champions, with a father who ran a women's clinic. But to actively work against those in the same scenario you yourself could find you're in, it's unforgivable. Like someone who benefited from social security trying to abolish it for others. 
&gt; Can you please explain how Citizens United violated my right to vote?  If you agree that money should decide, then I'm sure it doesn't. 
  Like comparing a duck to a herd of mooses. if you do not understand the difference between a huge corporation using their money to buy politicians, and a guy pushing his movie, you are not trying very hard. This is about corporations and the wealthy setting up PACs to buy elections and politicians. The Kochs are spending a billion this election. That is the same thing as Moore passing out election papers in Traverse City. I just don't get i suppose. 
So you are telling me I didn't actually vote in the last election? Was it all a dream then?
Isn't that what congress is supposed to do? Debate the potential laws? Not just blindly approve whatever the president thinks is right?  1. More. Year.
Well, have you seen the general view of citizens united around here?
People really need to ignore Bush 2.0.   It just amazes me how big of a blind side democrats have when the president is a democrat.  Oh he's black... he cant possibly be against civil liberties, he's a progressive!  What a joke.  The guy executed american citizens with no due process just like a common tyrant.  But its cool, he's a progressive! Really he is!!!   /facepalm   
are you saying that us commies think Bernie is Stalin, cause we dont, we are really sick of liberals calling Bernie a socialist  
sometime it's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that people are cool with incredibly bank-breakingly expensive expenditures that do nothing but line people's pockets (like mass producing surplus tanks that the army doesn't want and is sick of storing) but *help people*?  Then people would be *at home and lazy* instead of starving on the streets!  There's a segment of America that is simultaneously disgusted by the poor and wants to pretend they don't exist, but insists on maintaining systems that ensure that the poor exist and remain poor.  I'd rather be coddled than dead.
&gt;One policy catches you when you fall.  At the expense of malinvestment and conversion
Nice meme
Who decides whether or not the claims are misleading?  Or are you saying we should ban people and organizations from engaging in political speech? No more ads by Planned Parenthood saying "Vote against this referedundum that bans abortion" or "so-and-so wants to ban birth control". No more statements by the ACLU saying that this bill allows the NSA to spy on Americans and that we should call our representatives and tell them to vote against it. The NEA can't say that they support the candidate who favors strong teachers unions, and AARP can't publicly denounce bills to privatize social security.  What you are suggesting is in strong violation of the First Amendment. Political speech is protected, and that means you cannot restrict it, even if doing so would have arguably beneficial effects.
Maybe you should support a more popular candidate rather than blame the voting method?
I didn't know what those sites were until now. I consider myself a moderate centrist and avoid partisan politics as much as possible. Both parties in the US are plagued by fanatics that will follow their party regardless of what their elected officials do. Hardcore Obama supporters are a great example of this. Elected officials in both parties seem to agree on one very important issue, American politics is pay to play.
Yeah that isn't too unusual here in utah, they probably live somewhere like southern California where costs are insane and just assume everywhere is like that. 
Yeah US politics is confusing at the best of times. If it were up to me I'd outlaw both parties and start from scratch.
&gt;&gt;we should just not let shadowy 3-rd party groups make misleading claims at all  And how would we determine what groups are  a) shadowy, and b) 3-rd (3rd ;) party  And what would determine a "misleading claim"?  You arguing here are a 3rd party, are you not?  Does that mean only people directly involved in a "debate" are allowed to speak?  Ouch.  Good luck representing other views in that schema.  Michael Moore is a 3rd Party.  And I'm sure he received his funding from somewhere.  So would the group who funded him be considered shadow-y?  And would scenes in his documentaries be considered misleading because of his editing?  They say the way to defeat bad speech is with more good speech.  Not by banning bad speech.  Major organizations like the ACLU supported the Supreme Court on this decision.  We can agree with the problem, but the solution you and others are proposing frighten me and a lot of others people, liberals, conservatives, and everything in between.
&gt; To be real, they did sponsor quite a number of horrific terrorist organisations.  Which "horrific terrorist" organizations are you referring to exactly?
Quick question, if CU was decided simply by having a case accepted by SCOTUS and their ruling, can CU be reversed by the same process - a case reversing it is accepted by a SCOTUS comprised of different judges and their decision could be different than the previous courts?  
Trade Agreements are secret so American Businesses and Consumers can get the best trade deal offer. If we open it up, then we might lose in a freetrade deal that lifts all boats because there would be too many amendments and hidden secrets exposed.   
Reading the comments to that article, it kinda strikes me that the people who most want to preserve the right to own guns unrestricted are exactly the last kind of people in the world I would want running around armed.  
They seem intent on enforcing all the rules established previously. Every time I request a public dialogue on the question of what is or isn't on-topic I get ignored.
I wasn't aware Jack Hunter did either of those things.
Those judges were defending free speech from a government that wanted the power to ban books, magazines, movies, etc.   If that's "activism" then I'm all for it.
I think owning a firearm is their way of saying fuck the man.  Or that they're free.  Or that they have power.  Generally they know a lot about gun rights and their knowledge pool gets quite shallow from there consisting of talking points and  jingoisms.  They like uniforms and flags and order.  I wonder what the insurance actuaries have to say about it.
His employees seem to be alive if they are working for him, seems they already have a living wage.
[It's already happening.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/health/tobacco-industry-tactics-limit-poorer-nations-smoking-laws.html?_r=0) As long as there is language along the lines of countries not being able to willfully interfere with trade, which I find likely, corporate lawyers will certainly use that to argue and litigate against regulation they don't like.  
&gt;Propoganda: Canada has a news media that can actually include unbiased coverage of world events unfolding. The USA is like Russia with brainwashing garbage news. I have to watch Canadian news just to see what is really being said about events as they unfold. Not the view the billionare class wants me to know.  Are you fucking serious? Canadian media is biased as shit. The Sun has massive right-wing bias, and everything else has massive left-wing bias. Watch MSNBC if you prefer "Canadian style" (left-wing biased) American news. 
It seems to me we are no longer represented on many very serious concerns.
There is the recent arms deal with North Korea they were caught in recently.  Their dealings with brutal South American dictators is troubling.  Persecution of their own political dissenters is a problem.  Cuba is very comfortable inflicting terror on Cubans and working with others to inflict terror on their own people.
Either you have a source for your claims or you don't, and obviously you don't or else you'd have posted it instead of attempting to beat around the bush and push the argument forward without putting in any effort to at least prove your bullshit claims.

  Did Moores company make donations to a politician? of course not. Did the corporations in Citizens get the ability to pour money into elections? of course they did. That was the point. If you think those are the same things, that is not thinking very hard at all.  That was a crap question. Try harder.
All Americans should be behind him even if they do not support his views on other issues.
I have started and successfully run, a couple of businesses.  When you have done the same, give me a holler.    Reddit seems to be a hotbed of Randian fever dreams now days.
&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  Nowhere does it say you have the right to speech. It says you have freedom of speech, not the right to speech.    Money is only covered under freedom of speech when it is being used to purchase a platform from which to speak from. 
This posting is so /r/politics I can't even
I did read the dissent  I have read the whole court case: but I find the majority opinion to be more meaningful and to the issue  What I said and meant by simple: is that the facts of the case aren't too technical yet people misconstrue the court case so much; mostly because people don't read the court case  The dissent, unlike the majority, focused on the emotions rather than the letter of the law.  Stevens argued that ruling in favor of CU, would worsen an atmosphere where citizens view politicians as bought and sold. Roberts is a different type of justice, you can see this in the obamacare ruling where he states it's not the job of the courts to act as the legislature and to make good decisions for them it is however their job to rule on the constitutionality of issues.  The dissent was more concerned with elections while the majority more concerned with speech 
Dear Great Leader:  I sure "hope" they don't "change" their fucking minds, you POS! 
of course the union money funneled to Democrat politicians is typically not included in these counts either...  Is there any wonder why they really fight so hard for unions?
I have some interaction with poor/homeless. Unfortunately  there are some who can work but chose not to. 
Is she goinf Bernie Sanders on us?  /r/SandersForPresident
I would  say many of them see commercials for politicians who are paid for by people who benefit from this.  
You mean how Obama was the first candidate from a major political party to forgo a publicly financed campaign because it comes with restrictions on the amount one can spend.  Same as Obama ran the most expensive election campaign in US history; then broke that record during his bid for re-election.  Yep, he's definitely a member of the GOP.
a thought: maybe welfare started this? maybe there are more single parent homes now because welfare rewards that behavior? maybe welfare recipients deal drugs because it's a cash business?
Good point. And union cash is confiscated to begin with from it's generally non-billionaire members through dues.
If you raise taxes on the riches, the trickle will head back *up*!

Most states apply sales tax to EVERYTHING, including food and other household necessities, which is a pretty big difference to what VAT is applied to in most European countries. Tax on these essential items disproportionately affects the poor, since it takes more out of the little money they already have.
Just wondering, why would you expect the govt to ban working a certain number of hours for non safety type jobs?
&gt; Yeah, but willful homicide in violation of the is the definition of murder.  I think you a word.
Piss me off
Yes but it's also the only place (in utah) that would allow such a program. Everywhere else would have the conservative Fox news attitude mentioned by the above comment.
That is not even a little bit correct. One does not affect change in state law by people seeing a complaint on Reddit, but by persuading a legislator to introduce a bill or support the passage of a bill. Period.
Well, I don't work like that. And I'm mystified why you do. You don't want to learn? How does that work?
actually it goes, pay American citizens 17000 for working, or give American citizens 11000 doing nothing.  The fear is that if you give 11000 for doing nothing, more and more people will choose to do nothing... in the long run your cost will go way up because you have a lot more people doing nothing.   Or you can keep your head in the sand and pretend it's not more complex than you think it is

I'd say a big factor in whether or not a business decides to uproot itself and relocate to a different state for tax reasons would be whether or not they believe the tax cuts were sustainable.  If I owned a small business there's no way in hell I'd go through the bullshit with relocating it to Kansas if I wasn't completely convinced that those tax cuts were going to be around for a long time.  I mean, what if I relocated there and then they couldn't maintain the tax cuts and had to raise them again after I'd already relocated?  I'm sure every company would have the same thoughts and they all reached the same conclusion -- the tax cuts were politically motivated and made no financial sense and they were going to disappear soon when the politicians realized they were too expensive. So...they just stayed put.  Anyone could have predicted this.
The civility of Paul family supporters has really gone downhill in the past 7 years.
Republican maths is hard. 
&gt;Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty program ever created. And you want to get rid of it  Politicians have gotten rid of it already.  It can't survive, not because it was a bad idea, but because they have looted it to pay for all of the other things that they wanted to give away to the american public, but couldn't be paid for.  It is now on a collision course with reality, and the money doesn't exist to pay it back to the citizens that it was taken from.  Something has to be done about this. 
The government is generally not going to act in your best interest, because it is an impersonal instituon that has no incentive to, so it is generally in your best interest to be free from its control to the greatest degree possible. SS for example provides quite a low interest rate and is perilously reliant on the solvency of one government and the future health of one economy, in every country where it exists.  This system is not going to last. Socialism cannot work. Greece is just a harbinger of things to come. Just as animals in a zoo lose their ability to fend for themselves, domesticated humans, who have lost their freedom and become wards of the government, lose their ability to sustain themselves.
/r/politics in a nutshell.
Just start calling jail/prison "super welfare".  Many people don't realize that it is often cheaper to provide benefits to the poor than putting them through the justice system.
I guess you've solved it. If only other urban cities around the country were less Mormon and not full of fox news watchers we could solve this problem. 
If you're showing up to a gun fight, you bring a gun, even if you think maybe people should just use swords instead.
No. Because unions are set up specifically for advocacy. Their members are not forced to contribute to political issues they do not support. They are also subject to far more stringent reporting requirements than corporations are.  And if you are making a movie about a current political candidate, you are clearly engaging in political speech. So yes, you should have to do from somewhere else than hidden behind the artificial construct of a business corporation using money that was not given to it specifically for that purpose.  That would be taking someone else's "free speech" without their explict knowledge and consent.
And of course, there are no examples of countries where this, or programmes like it, *have* worked, because Europe, Australia and New Zealand don't exist...
[Bernie did it first.](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/10/bernie-sanders-promises-nominate-supreme-court-justices-overturn-citizens-united.html) But please, Hillary, keep trying to convince us that you're legitimately concerned about money in politics, and you're not just scrambling to hold onto your primary lead by posing as a progressive.
Yep and Leeland Yee is a prime example of how all democrats behave, right?   You're pathetic. 
psst, over here, I have a bridge to sell you. Don't tell anyone because it is just between you and me.
Nah definitely not
It was the "will of the people" that sentenced these people to death in the first place.  Those sentences of death didn't happen in a vacuum.
unless you are a mutibillionaire, maybe, most likely no
Hillary IF i believed you that would be the magic words to make me vote for you.  But I dont, so I can't.  Mind you I'm still going to hold my nose, hate myself the next morning, and still vote for you if you have a (D) next to your name.
Don't worry. She's a leftist. It's understood every word that comes out of her mouth is either complete nonsense or a complete lie.
I'd rather spend 10K on a Howitzer ... you know what for.
Could you explain what you mean a bit more?  In what way do you feel "the general views/themes expressed on reddit" are useful?
Not his party affiliation, the fact that despite a handful of decent things, the Libertarian political ideology is a load of complete horseshit that would disadvantage a large chunk of people that Libertarians don't give a fuck about.
&gt;"Taxes are our dues — we pay our dues to be Americans and enjoy the benefits of American society. Taxes are what we pay to live in a civilized society that is democratic, offers opportunity, and has a huge infrastructure available to all citizens. This incredible infrastructure has been paid for by previous taxpayers. Roads and highways, the Internet, the broadcast airwaves, our public education system, our power grid — every day we all use this vast infrastructure. Our dues maintain it.  lol...  Our "infrastructure", our roads and highways, the Internet...these were all done out of **military necessity.**  They were valid national security concerns, not some "the government is here to help" initiative.  Broadcast radio, television, computers, and power grids were PRIVATE initiatives.  Believe it or not, the government didn't build that.  They regulated it.  
Except that the free market is a total farce.

Great counterpoint! The Clintons made $25 million last year in speaking fees. I guess $500,000 from the worlds biggest investment bank isn't all that much.  /s
Being homeless probably makes people mentally ill (if they weren't already).
*"regressive flat tax"*  Wait... what? That's an oxymoron...
Why would someone admit to being such a low-information voter in a self post?    The mischaracterization of the Citizens United decision is laughable.  Predictable, but laughable.
Yeah it's great for business owners, you can exploit employees with no risk of litigation. Not so great for employees.
I wouldn't call that running a political campaign. More like a propaganda operation.  And I doubt she's going to fight very hard for campaign finance reform because her biggest donors wouldn't want that. And we know she can't say her donors aren't influencing her actions. 
If someone were to claim that you were a thief, it would not be unreasonable for me to scrutinize your behavior as you walk through my store.  If I were to then notice that you were wearing a number of items sold in my store would I have a reasonable concern?  Certainly.  Had no one made the accusation, the fact that you were wearing those items would probably not have given me pause absent some other shifty behavior.  Combined with the accusation, however groundless, they create reasonable doubt.
No because equal speech doesn't exist   Equality of speech would force people to speak less or would force to speak more   
THE MAN
I know everybody is freaking out about jobs and the effect this will have, but at it's core this is a geopolitical alliance against China, who has decided to start throwing it's weight around in the region.  I am on the fence about it, whether or not it is worth the cost.  But there are bigger things at play here.
I thought it was because they didn't want to enrage the locals who have enough time on their hands to convince other advertisers to boycott the station.
I had to wait 5 frickin' minutes to respond because of some dumbass sub related rule.  I've been on reddit for two fucking years and I have to wait 5 minutes between posts?  Fuck you, /r/politics -- I'm unsubscribing.
Give me one 20 year period or longer in which social security paid better than the stock market? (say a generic S&amp;P fund). In the history of ss, it has never paid better than the stock market. Is it really risky if it has never gone bad?
A lot of people dislike Rand Paul because he came into this issue that some people had been fighting since 2001 and pretends like it is all about him.  It took over 40 Senators voting against cloture to get us to where we are now. If it wasn't for at least 41 Senators voting against the extension, it would've already become law.   http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195  Rand Paul's grandstanding and pretending like he is doing this alone just pushes other Senators away from supporting the right position because Rand Paul is just going to take the credit.
Article about it here http://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/tv-station-refuses-to-air-ad-about-gay-republican-soldier-wh#.gpgx94O4X5   The response from the station: &gt;“It’s just a very controversial and personal issue, and we just choose to not air a commercial on either side of that debate,” Tom Tolar, the president and general manager of Chatanooga-based WRCB, told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview.  If this is their argument I hope that they aren't showing any ads at all that could be on one side of a debate. Really anything could be "controversial" in this sense. It would be great if someone found a bunch of ads that they have shown about issues, or like an anti- same sex marriage one. I guess this station must not air political campaign ads as well.  &gt;The ad crossed the station’s lines, he explained, because “people probably have really strong opinions on one side or other of the debate. It’s just an emotional debate for many people.” The station, an NBC affiliate that also broadcasts in parts of Georgia and North Carolina, didn’t have a position on ads about same-sex marriage until executives reviewed the commercial featuring Ehrenfeld on Wednesday, said Tolar. “We had not had a request before to run an issue-ad like that.”  Overall it's just a weak excuse for saying how they are (or they think their viewers are) massive homophobes.   &gt; “I respect that they have to manage their TV station as they see fit,” [Ehrenfeld, the speaker in the ad] said in a phone call with BuzzFeed News. “But it seems they just created this policy out of thin air when presented with this ad.”   To add on, this appears to be a problem only for this one station &gt; Of the roughly two-dozen other commercials the group has run around the United States, he said, none has been rejected. For example, stations are airing the commercial over the next week in Nashville and Memphis.
Yes, attention whore. If it hadn't been for over 41 Senators supporting each of the filibusters, these extensions would've passed at the last vote. But take a look at Rand's statement in the article - not a mention of anyone else fighting on these issues.   http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00194  He's trying to take all the credit and doesn't even care if it makes these programs more likely to be continued.  There are some Senators who have been fighting against these programs since they were first authorized in 2001, not that you will hear about them from Rand or the media.
If you asked me if this was a quote from Obama or a quote from Bush, I honestly would have no idea. 
I'll get behind him once he starts acknowledging all the Senators who had to vote against cloture in the last set of votes to stop these programs from being law:  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00194  The reason people don't like him is that he is turning this issue that some people have been fighting since 2001 and making it all about him.   One Senator cannot block legislation by himself - if 60 Senators had come together to vote against cloture in either of the previous votes, an extension of these programs would probably already be law. Yet he pretends like he did it all himself - just read the statement he put out.
If the poor had internet access, they might be informed. They might actually learn how badly they're being screwed by Republicans, who are even willing to let their children starve.   As crazy as it is, the religious right believes that if people are poor, it's their own fault. It's part of their "prosperity gospel". 
But the people won't like it, so the lobbies don't like that idea.  After all, the people having a voice in their own government?  What, are we a weak country?
It's unfortunate how racist some of reddit is. By reading this thread, I don't anticipate the USA to get any better. 
I'm keeping an open mind until I see all the candidates. Hillary was also a shoe-in back in 2008 until she wasn't.  As far as the Republican side goes, well, I've only seen candidates I'd rather vote shoebox than see elected.
Many Fox viewers and Limbaugh listeners are so conditioned as to prefer that government spend more just to punish those who've made a couple bad choices or who have been unlucky. 
&gt; Constitutional ban on gay marriage  He thinks federal government should have no say in marriage,  and there is no constitutional right to marriage anyway.
I answered your initial question. You are not limiting speech. You are limiting businesses from spending from their general treasuries while still allowing people to fully exercise their rights to free speech. You are not limiting speech in any way whatsoever. 
&gt;He's only a terrible candidate if you have contradictory political views, which not all people do.   Or he's a terrible candidate because his policies won't work.  That is some asinine logic, incredibly myopic. You could say that about anything. Honestly, what would you say if someone said that to you about a candidate you didn't agree with? "Hey I guess you're right, maybe candidate X isn't so bad. I just have contradictory political views."

The CBC is fairly unbiased.  I mean it is truthful though, so that might come across as a liberal bias to some.
&gt; So you no longer are saying that more money will always win?  Does the best team in baseball win every game?  No.  Did it spend the most money on players?  Frequently.  Why are you concerned with the word "always."  All other things being equal, if David Koch spends less money, he will lose.  That's what I said.    I don't see the word "always" anywhere.   
Thanks for the info, HillaryClinton4Prez!
Look at the GOP and Libertarian meddling in Chile, during Pinochet's reign, for example #2.
Almost as funny as someone ignoring the dozens of supportive messages to criticise the few unsupportive ones and label them representative of liberalism. Get fucked.   On this issue Paul deserves our support, and he gets it. Your attempts to imply he doesn't get liberal support exposes you as just as petty as the few morons who can't see past their dislike for the man to support his position.
She was the senator for New York, I don't think it's too early to know her position on banking. She's been working for them for years.
I think he is well acquainted on these issues having been a U. S. Senator since 2007, you can look at his voting record.  Compare him to the Republican Senate presidential candidates like  Ted Cruz, Mark Rubio, Rand Paul.
honestly I don't trust any of the numbers that come out of Utah.
My thought exactly.  
Considering they mostly seem to want to cut welfare programs, it's not surprising that they want to prevent new programs that help the poor from starting up.
Such a childish position to start from. You start by thinking someone is evil rather than a legitimate difference of opinion.  I'm not going to outright say you're in high school, but that your emotional maturity is.
The party? Grow up sonny. Your treasured pieces of shit politicians with the other uniform are as bad or worse and only represent you in a superficial way. 
Its terrifying that the man who is doing this and I agree with also doesnt agree with the Civil Rights Act. What a world
Exactly.  A lot of this privatization/deregulation shit is just, "Guys, let's go back to how things were before."  Motherfucker how things were sucked, that's why we have these things.
First of all OP, you need to quit smoking. Then worry about breaks. 
I have three points to make about this.  1. Hey! I live in Kansas! 2. I feel like this article is somewhat biased.  3. I consider myself conservative, but the people who idiotically rant against taxes have their heads up their asses. 
And that doesn't strike you as insane?
&gt; QUESTION: to you or anyone who feels the way you do is, why do you think its okay for the government to restrict a groups freedom of speech simply because that speech is dealing with politics?  Corporations, and also non-profit organizations like Citizens United, receive a number of special protections and privileges from the government as part of their charter. It is not unreasonable for the government to demand certain concessions from that group when they incorporate, including limiting their speech. It can be compared to, for example, demanding that an individual sign an NDA before giving them access to certain information, or the various limitations placed on individuals who have security clearance from the government.  I would have no problem with a group of people who did *not* incorporate, and who were *not* given tax-exempt status, saying whatever idiotic thing they wanted in whatever national or local medium they chose, for any amount of money they want to piss away. As soon as they start asking for special treatment from the government, however, they ought to accept whatever restrictions come with that.
Engineers are all "liberals."  So Wisconsin shouldn't have any?  Competitive advantage of the US to which UW contributes greatly is "liberal."    Is this what Scott Walker is all about?   The tenure thing is going to destroy UW and that will destroy the state economy. 
Got it. So there's some hope, though it's clearly an uphill battle.
Shit political ideologies are not just a matter of a different opinion, even more so when it's clear its policies could and will harm people if enacted.
That was never in question. The publicly available portion of the senate report clearly states that the Saudis/royal family provided a large portion of assistance to the highjackers. 
It's clear there needs to be more transparency.  Allowing only politicians and CEOs to contribute to the bill, and to even learn its contents, is undemocratic.  Declassifying the TPP would be the easiest way, but there are other ways if the government is insistent on a certain level of secrecy.  Perhaps there needs to be some form of citizen advocacy group allowed, people who can be trusted to act with responsible disclosure.  There has to be a reasonable balance between the interests of wealthy minorities and the interests of tyrannical majorities.  What's clear is that more eyes - and more moral eyes - are needed before it can be in the best interest of the people.  Because how else can the peoples' interest be protected?
I'm going to step in here and explain why everyone is freaking out saying Social Security is going bankrupt.  First.  Yes.  The entire Social Security Trust Fund was used to expand the budget for decades.  All that remains in the coffers is Special Issue Treasury Bonds.  We owe ourselves about 3 Trillion Dollars, not including other intragovernmental debt.  Regardless of what people tell you.  You cannot owe yourself money, be broke, and simultaneously have that money.  It isn't possible.  As Social Security goes into negative numbers, the money from the Trust Fund will have to be borrowed on a yearly basis, increasing the deficit, as we do not have the money and the forecast is for budget deficits as far as the eye can see.  But honestly, the real problem isn't social security.  We can deal with Social Security as a single problem.  The big problem is Medicare and Medicaid. These programs weren't designed to deal with the current medical world we live in, where people live longer, and get to use all the wondrous medical technology we have invented.  Not to mention the sweetheart deals we give Big Pharma, and the COMPLETE failure of healthcare reform.  I'm sure most people don't understand. What we got from the Affordable Care Act was the POLAR OPPOSITE of why Obama tried to press through Healthcare Reform.  It was supposed to drive down costs significantly, but the Health Insurance Lobby under their lead negotiator Karen Ignagni completely reneged on the deals she made with Obama.  So Obama had to pass something as far too much political capital had been expended to back off...  According to  the Congressional Budget office.  By 2030, all we will be able to afford with our income is Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt.  Everything else will have to be borrowed.  Military. Highways. Coast Guard.  Whatever pet project you like that the Federal Government does...  NASA, NOAA&lt; whatever... Everything else will be borrowed. Everything.  By 2050.  All we will be able to afford is the interest on the debt.  Can you comprehend what they are saying?  Some debt is good.  We are long past that point.  The time for action was honestly about 2 decades ago.  It isn't about finding a way out of our problem anymore.  It is about making the catastrophe as small as possible.  We are well past the point of no return.  We have some very tough choices to make.  But nothing is being done.  And nothing will be done.  Until the last minute.  Because to do something now would be political suicide.  And the politicians are far more worried about their careers and special interests than they are about what is good for this country.  So instead of making some tough choices now.  We are going to wait until the world drops the US Dollar as the Worlds Reserve Currency.  When they realize that the US Dollar is going to tank, someone is going to start selling a lot of T-Bonds.  It will be like a run on a bank.  Once it starts it will spread like wildfire.  And we will enter the Second Great Depression.  Unless we start doing something.  I'm not holding my breath.
reddit is shockingly homogenous and disproportionately made up of stormfront expatriates and bourgeois fuckwits
If taxes are so good, why don't all you pay more in taxes? The federal government will not mind if you calculate your tax returns to show you $1,000, but instead send them a check for $10,000.  Put your money where you mouth is; if you think taxes are so great, why aren't you spending all your money on taxes? Oh... I see. You don't want to pay more taxes because you think it's good. You want ME to pay taxes because you can benefit from my money. Got it.
Get a different job.
I've never seen a line of potential applicants lined up at any fast food restaurant. Then again, I don't live in Virginia so I don't know.
Uh what are you talking about Bernie is staunchly against it. He's voted against it every single time.
Too bad the US doesn't have a liberal party.
&gt;exactly the last kind of people in the world I would want running around armed.  You would prefer just hardened criminals have the firearms? When seconds count, the police are minutes away. 
Ssshhh.... Don't be so racist with your facts bro.
Ah I love me a false equivalency. 
Paul joined the establishment this election.
yes those infamous limbaugh acolytes running california. &gt;California has more anti-homeless laws on average than other states, punitive local ordinances targeting the homeless for standing, sitting or resting in public.
Being super suspect. He was buddy buddy with Jeffrey Epstein a d flew to his private island a few times.
She has proven time and time again to be totally submissive to wealth. So obedient and passive when money is waved in front of her. She is a fantastic employee for our wealthy overlords, always has been.
The question is, with a record like hers reflecting general apathy about corporate abuse or labor struggles, someone whose largest donors are banks and corporations, how do we discern what is just talk and what is real promise?
Me, personally?  I'd prefer neither have them, honestly.  I can count the amount of times 'seconds have counted' on one hand, in my lifetime, and I grew up in the hood. I can also say for sure that in exactly zero of those situations would a gun have helped.  So, *for me*, there is no positive net gain in having more people with more guns around. At least the 'hardened criminals' (is there a such thing as a 'softened criminal'? That's such a scare phrase) I knew had rules as to who they'd shoot and why.  These yahoos in the comment section? Yeah, some of them seem to see the threat of jackboots when the price of bread goes up, and 'hardened criminals' all around them. And since the new trend of allowing 'I felt threatened' as sufficient excuse to shoot someone dead, they're more ready than ever.  But that's my personal experience.   I believe that the vast majority of gun owners will never use their guns in a confrontation, and don't ever want to.  Honestly, criminals are included in that group, because until they commit a crime, they're just gun owners like everyone else.   But I am equally dismayed by anyone who is eager to use their gun for its intended purpose, and I don't really care what they claim that reason is- because they're ready and waiting for an excuse to kill someone, and I don't want to be that someone.  In the end, it's one of our enumerated rights, and until that amendment is repealed, I have to accept that fact, and I do. Doesn't mean it's what I want. I'd be happy with a lot less guns in the US, and a lot less people owning and especially carrying them, and a lot less being manufactured and sold here.  I'm okay with not getting what I want. I'm much less okay with those kinds of folks getting what they want.
I'm for banning political commercials altogether but thanks for your wrong opinion on me. 
Lol... Proving his point even more... Well done
Fuck these people.
LOL, as if the Clinton Crime Syndicate family is not just as paid-for as the GOP.    Bitching about money while having the Clinton's head your ticket is the *height* of hypocrisy.

They're going to harm people who want to learn medicine, engineering, math, finance and accounting simply because they want to go after a couple liberal history and environmental science professors. Makes sense.
Which is kind of funny because in China you do have to take breaks. You can get huge fines for things like that well assuming you don't know the right people. 
... so I guess that makes it ok. No conflict of interest here. #TaylorSwift 4Prez.
Remember Timmy, only Communists support progressive taxes! Be a Republican capitalist and hit the public with the bill with the regressive tax they can't even argue with! And don't forget your other pals CIVIL FORFEITURE and his MUNICIPAL FINES!!! Down at Republican Playhouse! *** No Brown people Allowed, unless you're naturalized Cuban American  ***
Great source... Interesting how it only talks about the negatives. But it's like they say, "there's only one side to every story."
Losing one child must be tough, losing a second one is unthinkable. Prayers for the Biden family.
It doesn't bother me that politicians don't listen to the people.  Ideally, they should be acting in the best interest of the people, but people are shortsighted and selfish.  So nodding politely and pretending to listen is perhaps the most valuable skill they have.  What infuriates me is that they seemingly don't care about the citizens.  And we keep electing the most corrupt, ignorant assholes we can dredge out of the sewer.
Lol America is all about making rich people richer, and enslaving poor people. Get with the times, man!
Since no one here is taking up Jeb Bush's flag, I guess I will. So, direct any climate science questions at me. I'm not a scientist and I don't know any scientists, I also really don't read much about science, but I'll gladly answer your science questions.
Just another way to put your name on a round-up list.

Hey, I dislike Hillary as much as the next libertarian, but she's got more balls than just about anybody in Congress!
Progress screws Americans. Trade and the passage of time especially. So you create a fund to retrain people.   And of course, progress is, on balance, a good thing. So is trade, especially if you get some reasonable regulation in there. 
I understand your point. Its a fine idea to bring up and surely one worthy of a thoughtful response. I often hear this argument. While your certainly correct that there will be a definite decrease in the number of employable people due to a basic income, this should not be viewed negatively. This is a positive. The more people that do not have to depend on selling their labor to others in pursuit of others profits, the more time they have to invest in themselves and work in things that interest them. Whether that is raising a child, learning a skill they have always wanted to have, pursuit of knowledge, the limitations are only set by the individuals themselves. This has hidden cost benefits to society that far outweigh the reduction in employable people; especially considering that there currently are way to many people for the number of jobs we have. Some of the hidden benefits will be the unexpected scientific/personal/emotional discoveries that will come, the advancement of personal well being and its reflection into society, an individual who can still spend money into society, an individual who won't be subject to costly life crisis such as ER care or homelessness, an individual who is more likely to properly raise children which will in turn save society money. The possibilities are limitless. Studies have shown; in societies which have a strong safety nets, it results in the motivation of those individuals to work harder. There was a study on r science somewhere about this. This isn't at all taking into account the break neck advancement of our scientific knowledge. All this technology will result in the creation of technological devices/beings/algorithms that far surpass the capabilities of organic biological beings. This is a fact. Its inevitable.   Rant inc:  Your job isn't that important anyways. Its the means by which your shackled. Try to leave your job and see what happens. I dont care you dont like it. I dont care what you think about it. I dont give a fuck. Just show up, be there for a satisfactory amount of time. And do this till your about to fucking die. That is the old way, if you were lucky. There is a far brighter dawn if were smart enough to seize it. Brighter for everyone.

Not really in this day in age is this protection really necessary look at  the response to the companies that come out as anti gay  they get  boycotted into apologizing and changing policies all the time.
Well, thank goodness smarter people prevailed then. 
Huckabee is like the Pope for the Devil.  Have you ever seen him playing and singing in the band with Ted Nugent.  It is the most disgusting thing I've ever heard or seen and it has more profanity than the entire crew of my Submarine would say on an entire patrol.  However, he has the nerve to stand up and propose a fight against profanity?  It is well beyond hypocrisy.  That isn't even as bad as his use of his FOX show to spread hate and judgment against the people he doesn't agree with, who do not engage in creating pornographic music like Huckabee does.  Anyone who follows Huckabee is a Devil worshipper, whether they realize it or not.
No shit.  The TPP isn't taking jobs. People in other countries willing to work harder for less are.   That's the signal for us to make something else. 
I've always liked his father and their family. Not too many politicians have had children in the armed forces. Really just a sad news story. God bless a man who served his country so well both overseas and domestically.
Bill should mind his own god-damn business.
In 2010 Russ lost to a halfwit Ron Johnson who's campaign hinged on saying very little and riding the Obamacare wave into office.  He won't have the luxury this time around. 
Number one lesson I've learned on Reddit- do not argue with a guns rights advocate using statistics.   Why? Because it's very likely *you* didn't tabulate those statistics, firstly, so even you likely have no idea if they're correct, and secondly, it's very likely those statistics are being abused beyond all recognition.  I don't care what the permit revocation rate is. I don't care if the persons are law-abiding. None of that is relevant to my central points, honestly. For all I know the permit revocation rate is due to corrupt government or malfunctioning bureaucracy and the laws could be badly constructed and full of loopholes, making it very difficult to *not* be law abiding. Not saying that's what's going on, but that's why those statistics tell me nothing.  I do not want to die because a 'law abiding' gun owner 'fears for his safety' one night because I have one of the many items I possess that could conceivably look like a gun on me, or because i accidentally find myself on their property. If he didn't have that gun? He'd do what any sane human does, and avoid something that scares him unless and until he was cornered, and call the cops (who would shoot me anyways, but that's a different subject).   With that gun though? Suddenly they can 'stand their ground', and I can be put *into* the ground, and because of the magic words they will not suffer a bit for it.  Sorry, not a fan. Someone reading this, right now, is that dude. Who can't wait to use their gun. That guy is not who I want armed.
Clinton. Bush. Bush. Clinton. Why would we entertain the notion either of these people need our vote?
&gt; the Bill of Rights isn't just a list of the rights we have  Absolutely. I like to say that the Second, specifically, is designed to protect a civil right but also accidentally protects a human right.    If it were up to me, there would be a stated right in every state regarding lawful self-defense. I would also take at least the "firearms" part out of ATF, remove the federal requirement for background checks when purchasing from an FFL, and have each state abolish the requirement for carry permits.  As someone else said, I'm okay with not getting what I want. I'm much less okay with those kinds of folks getting what they want. (i.e. complete loss of civilian-owned firearms)
Yepper-apples and oranges-rotting on the tree
Not really: you are being heard right now   I'm being heard: we are engaging in speech. University professors are heard every day
Look it up. Google is your friend. It is well documented. 
Well its only eliminating the enshrinement of tenure in state law, Not baring tenure.  The UW system can choose to have tenure positions (which they 100% will for the reason you stated) the terms are just no longer set in state law.   Overall the impact is unknown since I am not sure how many (if any) states have tenure enshrined in state law and not as an agreement between the university and the professor. 
Utah is one of the most religious states in the country.   And yet they realized that conventional methods (while ok for temporary homeless) were not succeeding at helping the chronically homeless at no longer being homeless.  And they realized that the costs of dealing with the chronically homeless were greater than simply giving them real shelter.
In the Citizens United decision, the government was actually arguing that they could ban books if they wanted to.    Michael Moore makes movies with corporate money that attempt to influence the electorate.  Under your argument, government can ban those movies.    In fact, the entire Citizens United case was about government banning a movie that was critical of Hillary Clinton.  Emotionally, I'm sure you have no problem silencing people you disagree with, but intellectually you can't possibly support such an authoritarian position.    If you you think a politician is taking bribes, file a lawsuit, contact the media, blog about, don't vote the guy.  Endorsing government censorship to dissuade politicians from doing something that's already illegal punishes everyone and won't stop bribery. 
Capitalism is fantastic but only when moderated by socialism. Otherwise you end up with business's who have the same rights as people legally but none of the responsibilities that people do.
Yeah, to protect the public from sleepy drivers.  Absolutely.  But there are ZERO federal labor law protections for the drivers.  There is no such thing as a minimum wage.  No such thing as a 40 hour workweek with overtime.  And as to:  &gt;There are federal limits as to how long a driver can work each day.  You are lying.  Well, probably not deliberately but that statement is completely untrue.  So...you have a max of 11 hours you can drive in the day, and those 11 all have to be within a 14 hour window.  Right?  But let's say you're doing flatbed.  You drive to some place where you're going to take a load, get there right as the 11 and 14 hour clocks are gonna run out.  You can sleep in the truck on-site so that's not a problem.  But it's gonna rain.  The dock workers load you up with, say, lumber.  And it's going to take you three hours minimum to tarp and strap that shit, right?  Your 14 hour day is running out so you can't, right?  WRONG.  The 14 hour day isn't there to protect YOU, it's there to protect the public from you.  So you can absolutely keep working another three hours to strap and tarp that stuff.  Five hours.  Whatever it takes.  Your day is now 19 hours long.  Have you violated the hours of service rules?  NO - not as long as you take a 10 hour break after those 19 hours **before driving**.  Do that and boom, a fresh 11/14 clock starts.  (Yes, I've left out the 70 for this discussion.)  My point is, there are no protections *for the driver*.  Only for the public - rules against DRIVING while sleepy as hell, not rules against *working* while sleepy.  Different category of law.

Show me a major political party that isn't.
Tell me something: Do you think that there is some virtue in inefficiency? Should we go back to 10 acre farms as our food supply?  Anywhere that can't afford to pay a living wage is making the taxpayers pay it for them. 
Nor does anyone use the term "anti-life."
I'm glad to see he's following up his "filibuster" (which didn't really accomplish anything) with actual action.  If he can pull this off, great.
People find tossing American jobs aside reprehensible, even if it means a net benefit in the long run. I think trade deals are ultimately good because of comparative advantage, but I can understand where opposition are coming from.
How is Citizens United publishing a documentary about Hillary any less "freedom of the press" than the NYT publishing a newspaper?  Yes, "press" in the constitution refers to the printing press, and I suppose NYT does still use those, but the modern interpretation of "the press" is simply non-spoken speech (speech through media).
Actually, statistically, there is intelligence in masses. Some Communications theorists in the past asked a group of people to guess the weight of a cow, Survivor style (TV show). The group was remarkably close to the actual  weight.
As a woman, it is clear to me the piece Sanders wrote was not about rape fantasies, But a piece that used the presence of rape fantasies to talk about gender roles. No woman would fear that Sanders harbors rape fantasies based on that article.  The only thing he has to apologize for is the awful writing in the piece. It was clumsy, not well thought out, and frankly confusing at times. Writing is certainly not his strong suit. 
I was speaking generally. Obama bailed out the banks. He hasn't held a single banker to account for the massive fraud they committed. He's declared war on whistleblowers. He increased drone strikes in the Middle East. Guantanamo Bay is still open for business and so far has failed to hold anyone accountable for the torture committed there. The Affordable Healthcare Act is just a sneaky way to line the pockets of private insurance companies. He's more right-wing on a lot of issues that Bush was.
That would be crazy. He's not Kim Jong Un.
Not sure why Rolling Stone is wasting time paying attention to what he has said. They should just accuse him of rape and get that ball rolling. It'll be much more impactful in the long run.   
Utah is the reddest state...
He voted against the patriot act every time.  http://time.com/3850839/bernie-sanders-usa-patriot-act/
So given that he is talking about incentives to form worker coops rather than democratizing the work place of existing companies he would be a social democrat still just in the more historic meaning of the term. The early social democrats believed that through reform and regulation of a capitalist economy you could slowly convert it to socialism. This is distinct from the democratic socialists who believe that through electoral action a socialist revolution can be achieved that seizes property from the capitalist class and gives it to the workers in some form (there are other possible definitions but this is the one closest to social democracy so as to contrast them). Social democrats have historically not been considered socialists both by themselves and by other socialist movements due to not directly pushing for the removal of capitalist control.  Edit: And again not trying to be "sectarian" or whatever people like accusing the left of being and I am happy that I am wrong about at least promoting work place democracy if not the removal capital control. 
&gt; My money is on him being a closeted Sada-masochist, gay man. It's sad that these people hate themselves so much.  Dear zanacks,  You're hired.  Sincerely,   Rolling Stone
If it worked at all they would have caught the Boston bombers. It doesn't work. It should be scrapped.
Congress isn't admitting it. They'll tell everyone "this funding is only for people who will *temporarily* feel negative impacts but after awhile those same people will be doing better than before. Just like having unemployment insurance!".
Didnt we learn from NAFTA? The American **consumer** may benefit from these trade agreements,  but the American **worker** gets screwed. But it's cool - the corporations win either way...
Whoever is behind classifying it in the first place should face criminal prosecution - this abuse of the classification system has gone way past getting out of hand - it must be stopped and such abuse must be considered a serious crime.
Was it Norway after that dude shot up a youth group?
While I like the motives behind this legislation this type of execution would be terrible. It gives insurance companies even more power over people which IMO is terrible.  
Bernie Sanders wants to make rape legal?
For real. The first amendment gets shit on by the evangelicals constantly while they cry that any time of restriction on guns is some threat of big government.
Because Virginia seems to elect a lot of Democratic Senators and Congressmen.
take a good look at what else he is against.  It's pretty much everything.  He sees no service as a human right.  Sure, he may be in favor of eliminating somethings that you would like to see gone but he's still an extremest.
To be fair, the Palins left some state property in the Governor's Mansion after she quit to be a celebrity during her first term; Huckabee basically stole everything. Granted, the Palins didn't really use the mansion, and stole a ton of money through "per Diem," but still.

Whoa whoa no reason to bring religion into this. I was simply stating the obvious. No religious motives involved. I guess bashing religions on reddit is an easy way to get upvotes though. 
yes, shake up is what extremists mean to do.  yet their stance is not reasonable.
Those who trust but never verify.
&gt;Maybe you've got to vote for who you've got to vote for to keep the worse of evils from gaining power.  Fortunately, between now and the next presidential election there's  time to do a lot of education on root causes and strategies for bringing justice. Thanks, Bernie!
&gt;...and get that stone rolling.  FTFY
Thank you Hillary and your stupid pivot to Asia!
They can invest same as me. We get 2.5% of our annual income back to spend as we see fit. I can invest, or not. Same goes for everyone else. If they end up broke it is their own fault. 
You're honestly putting 2 over 1 and 4? 
&gt; You are basically saying that none of these organizations should be able to publicly state what they do and do not support, and should not be able to show advertisements as such.  Actually, I am only saying that these organizations, all of which receive special consideration from the government, should expect that they may have to give up certain constitutional protections in kind. ~~It's not unprecedented and I gave you two examples where individuals might do the same thing.~~ *(Oops! I thought I was responding to a different post, see below.)* Why should corporations or non-profits (yes, including all the ones you listed) be any different?  *(The examples given are: an individual signing an NDA before getting access to certain information, or the various limitations placed on individuals who have security clearance from the government.)*  So to answer your question:  &gt; So, instead of people who share common values being able to band together and pay for an ad, now only people rich enough to buy an ad can do so?  No, I'm not saying that at all, provided the group is not, for example, getting special protections from the government from torts such as libel, or an exemption from paying taxes on their fundraising. An informal group of people receiving no special dispensation from the government should be able to pool their resources however they like and say whatever they like.  &gt; Here are another couple of questions for you. Prior to Citizens United, the BCFRA banned organizations from mentioning the name of a candidate within two months of an election. Do you think the New York Times should not be allowed to talk about candidates? They are a corporation. What about Fox News? What about NBC, which is owned by Comcast. Should media corporations be the only ones who can have their voice heard?  If our duly elected representatives pass legislation limiting the freedom of speech protections afforded to media corporations or non-profits, then I see no constitutional issue with that since the limitations would be contingent on their privileged status. They are of course free to give up that privileged status whenever they like, if they would prefer to pay taxes or expose their investors to unlimited personal liability.  And just to be crystal clear, I am *not* saying I would support such legislation, only that I don't think it unconstitutional. And, if I were to *oppose* such legislation, I would have to do so on different grounds than I would, say, a blanket law saying that no one can talk about X under any circumstances, which I *would* consider a violation of basic human rights and unconstitutional.
Hmm.   &gt; 99.9999999999999999999% of gun owners never want to use their gun.  Right, lets see what these people say about that:  &gt; **Kizman** 10 hours ago @bot I say we give it to him. It's time for another million man march, this time with the million men fully armed, and not just there to protest.  TAKE IT BACK!!  &gt; **Tigtoodaend** 8 hours ago I'm with ya Kiz. Right on brother. Light up and let's load up  &gt; **rebelyell** 16 hours ago It's evident that Rep. (Baloney} Maloney doesn't own a gun!. Elected politicians NEVER pass anything that will tax their pleasures of if they do they also pass a loop-hole that eliminates them from having to pay it! No one (including the Government) knows if I own a weapon of any kind and they will only find out if they try to enter my home illegally!   &gt; **Rogue Elephant** 23 hours ago If I owned a small, but very lethal cache of weapons that I inherited, who the hell would know?  &gt; Aim for body mass.  &gt; Make the first shot count.  &gt; Put it where it does the most good.  &gt; Don't waste ammo.  ...and so on and so forth. You know as well as I do that I could do this for hours. And if you don't, you should start reading comments to these types of articles.  &gt; On the other hand, if you had a gun, suddenly that asshole isn't as big of a threat anymore, because you're a reasonable sane person who will only act appropriately.  If I had a gun I would be actually less safe. I am unlikely to be victim of a crime thanks to human nature and being at least a little streetwise, and I don't have a significant need for a deadly weapon in my daily life. My chance of being killed by a gun right now is minimal. That can only go up by introducing a gun to my life.  I'm not scared of hypothetical bare-hand psycho murderer or any 'hardened criminals' enough to put a deadly weapon in my home. However, I recognize that other people might not have such blessings and might want to have one around because of where they live.   Not to fend off 'psychos' but to deal with garden variety people trying to take what they have and willing to injure them in the process.  &gt; Nothing stops people from killing if they want to. Look at prisons. The most secure and regulated places on earth, yet people get murdered in prison constantly.  Doesn't mean we have to make it easier. I, personally, am not making it any easier. 
Again you ignore the simple question. Why can't you answer it? Do you need me to dumb it down a bit? I could rephrase it so even someone who was held me schooled could understand it. Please let me know if you need me to do this for you!
Looks like a Bernie crowd alright.
Quick read.  http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/law-comparative-advantage.asp  People for free trade aren't just plutocrats wanting their yachts and private jets. Many left leaning economists really are for markets being pretty open AND compensating people for when they lose their jobs.  There is downsides to free trade! The government should step in to buffer these and provide a safety net.   If the West wants to stay ahead they need to continuously improve and do things better. Unskilled manufacturing with high wages due to protectionism will keep some westerners employeed... For a while. Their kids will be fucked though as other countries leapfrog them.  EDIT: As people like Krugman have pointed out the TPP really doesn't reduce tarrifs that much though, it addresses things like copyright and IP, which is a completely different argument (and one where I take a different stance)
At least we got Obama-care.
That's sad to hear. As far as I know Joe Biden wasn't necessarily leaning toward running for president, and while he had high name recognition, he wouldn't have been considered much of a front-runner. Also, I don't know if this would necessarily prevent him from running for president. For all I know a good campaigning effort might be therapeutic for him.
Of the things to dislike about the TPP, free trade is not one of them.  Free trade is a *good* thing.   For everyone.  Oppose the TPP for the right reasons.
You have a multitude of Republicans to choose from.  Pick one. Pick several, funkalunatic.
Dude, everything needed to manufacture a single-shot scatter gun can be had for less than $50 at any hardware store in America. Think Liberator.   Also, I do ***not*** want to have a revolution. That's why we shake the rattle. Letting them know when they get too close.
It isn't about extreme left and right, it is about intellectual honesty. You can take the position that it will screw American works and address the data for and against your position argue that the data for your position is stronger and make a case. Maybe that will be an 'extreme' position. "Far left" in the US is pretty standard stuff in Australia &amp; Canada let alone Scandanavia.  That said most TPP articles are junk becuase its just shrill and not intellectually honest.
&gt; I will vote for Hillary only if I must.   Fuck Hilary. I'm a Democrat, but I also remember the Clinton years and she's a good old boy 1% approved product. If she's on the ticket, I'm voting Republican, why vote for the lesser evil?   Seriously, I'd rather throw it to Republicans and let them complete their journey of destruction so we can at last get pushed to the point of snapping and burning the entire system to the ground and starting all over again.   She'll just feed us enough bullshit to keep us from trending #BurnWallStreet, placating enough of the far left to give it all some fluff.

Way to quote a bunch of shit with zero context. Typical of statistic and logic ignoring anti-gun folk. As far as "aim for body mass, make the first shot count" etc, that's called *being a responsible gun owner*. If there's a threat to your safety, you want to end it as quickly and safely as possible, ie eliminating the threat efficiently and without endangering others.  Onto you owning a gun. You say you'd be less safe owning a firearm. That's purely because you're afraid and ignorant. I've got a G19 crammed in my waistband right now, and guess what? Hasn't gone off, hasn't magically shot an innocent. Actually, it's saved my life on two separate occasions. The only reason a gun **ever** increases danger to the owner is if they're an irresponsible idiot, the same as driving a car endangers you only if you don't maintain or operate it correctly.   You're not scared of a hypothetical psycho? Good. Fear is stupid. But you should be *aware and prepared*. I'm sure all those people in Aurora felt pretty safe watching a film. Yet their feelings didn't stop 5.56 from shredding their bodies.  You say you live in the hood and you're used to the streets. You may have walked to the store a thousand times and never gotten attacked. But there was someone else following the same path that did get attacked. Don't confuse luck with improbability.   Maybe try you know, actually handling a gun? Go to a range. Learn how they work and how to use them. As your fear and ignorance is replaced with knowledge, you might realize a whole lot about the world, and yourself. There's a reason over 100 million people own and enjoy firearms. And it ain't killing. 
&gt;You picked one of the most glaring examples of survey bias and can't defend it.  Actually I've done a pretty good job of defending it.  I've explained why your claims that the question was open-ended and opinionated are false.  I've also patently explained to you that similar surveys are not the results of a gigantic liberal conspiracy, but ongoing efforts by television advertisers to determine who exactly they're selling ads to.  Different television stations attract different demographics, and this fact is controversial to absolutely no one except you.
&gt; If it screws over Americans, why is it even being considered?  That's a really, really big over simplification. Would you rather America have been an isolationist nation?  Yes, at times, it will cause certain sectors to face hardship when trade partners can produce more efficiently, but the net gain is worth it.

It would take a lifetime to research all the Republican candidates, so I can't say for sure, but Rand Paul is the only one I can be pretty sure won't start WWIII. He's got major problems, but being anti-endless war and anti-NSA panopticon makes him the least worst of the right wing.
I have a problem with that, I want to solve those Problems. I also recognize abortions as a moral wrong. We should not decide who lives and who dies. 
Accidentally?  Not every property line is marked and not everyone knows where everyone's property lines are.   
I always thought he would run for President someday.  Maybe 2020 or 2024.  RIP Beau
This is something I've never understood about the 2nd amendment. If our government turns against the people and we must take up arms to protect our freedom, would handguns or even assault rifles do anything more than buy me a few minutes before I'm obliterated by the military with their far more powerful and sophisticated weapons? I'm not trying to be contrary, it just seems that the unlimited resources of the us military and police forces are very much at odds with this explicit intent of the 2nd amendment. 
That is admin imposed btw. 
Work is voluntary, as is living in Virginia.
Not to mention we put Saddam in power, gave him chemical weapons, gave him the green lite to invade kuwait... then spent trillions of dollars and thousands of lives stopping him from invading kuwait, taking away his chemical weapons and removing him from power.
The founding fathers would be puking right now
NAFTA has been a *good* thing.   Products are cheaper. More markets for our exports. Don't have to pay silly "tariffs" on things.  We don't have to pass the TPP, and we could even repeal NAFTA, just get rid of these godforsaken tariffs.
it's going to take some time, but one day /r/politics might understand that not every bad thing in this world comes from fox news, rush limbaugh, or conservatives. if you need context, see every other comment in this thread.
please esplain
Dunno why you're bringing up Democrats and talking about leftists. They've been right-wing centrists for a long while. There's no left wing in mainstream American politics, and the closest thing to it is Bernie Sanders, a populist hack who claims he's a socialist.
[It's kosher by federal law as well.](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/workhours/breaks.htm)
&gt; Way to quote a bunch of shit with zero context.   What context? The comments are copied whole. That *is* the context.   &gt; Typical of statistic and logic ignoring anti-gun folk.  Oh yes, here we go. Y'all attack in packs and you're pretty vicious too. I'll brace myself for the downvotes. Actually I'll just ignore this thread and stop answering orangereds for a while.  &gt; As far as "aim for body mass, make the first shot count" etc, that's called being a responsible gun owner. If there's a threat to your safety, you want to end it as quickly and safely as possible, ie eliminating the threat efficiently and without endangering others.  Right. Like there's so many threats that require a responsible gun owner to stop. The vast majority of people will end the vast majority of their days without a threat of any kind. There are way, *way* more guns and a lot more of those guys in the comments than there are threats.  &gt; Onto you owning a gun. You say you'd be less safe owning a firearm.    Opinions vary, but hey, since it's *my* life, I think i might be a little better authority on what I need in than you.  &gt; That's purely because you're afraid and ignorant.  Hey, I see you're taking the high ground...is that a hallmark of a 'responsible gun owner'?  &gt; I've got a G19 crammed in my waistband right now, and guess what? Hasn't gone off, hasn't magically shot an innocent.  Unsure how that's relevant to my life, but okay.  &gt;  Actually, it's saved my life on two separate occasions.   Great. I have no idea how many occasions my not having a gun has saved mine. I do know so far, not having a gun hasn't caused me to be killed, so that's something.  &gt; You're not scared of a hypothetical psycho? Good. Fear is stupid. But you should be aware and prepared.  Who says I'm not?  &gt; I'm sure all those people in Aurora felt pretty safe watching a film. Yet their feelings didn't stop 5.56 from shredding their bodies.  Telling me how safe guns make people while talking about how people were killed...with a gun...doesn't really help your point. had the guns not been there at all, how many people would've died that day?  &gt; You say you live in the hood and you're used to the streets. You may have walked to the store a thousand times and never gotten attacked. But there was someone else following the same path that did get attacked. Don't confuse luck with improbability.  Sure, probably. People get attacked for all kinds of reasons. Not seeing the relevance though.  &gt; Maybe try you know, actually handling a gun?  Uncle Sam kinda required it when i signed up.  &gt; Go to a range.   That too.  &gt; Learn how they work and how to use them.  That too.  &gt;  As your fear and ignorance is replaced with knowledge, you might realize a whole lot about the world, and yourself.   Oh great gun guru, could it possibly be that a gun is just a machine and not a vehicle to enlightenment? No? Guns don't teach you anything other than about the gun, and what a bullet does to things at high speed. everything else you can learn without it.  &gt; There's a reason over 100 million people own and enjoy firearms. And it ain't killing.  There are actually lots of reasons. Most of them pretty valid. More than I'd like are also pretty scary. If you ask me (which someone did, which is why I set myself up for the attack of the gunnuts in the first place) I'd happily give up never using a gun again if I could be sure those dudes didn't ever get one.   But that's me. I don't expect society to be forced to do what I want, just because it pleases me. Can you say the same? 
I'm so fucking tired of this fucked of political system we have! Fuck every last one of them. Fucking parasites, the whole lot. Were so fucked and cant do shit!!!!! its not sad, or bad, or anything its just g old. Fucking old!
I just wish people would become more informed on guns in general. Especially the super pro gun control and anti gun people.  I'm not trying to provoke anyone but I think what happens a lot anymore is that assumptions about guns are made without those people ever getting near one.  I don't mind if you have a different opinion but please, please get your facts correct.
I'm not reading all that. Sorry.
It screws over Americans the same way cars screwed over carriage drivers.  The assistance is supposed to help the carriage drivers become taxi drivers, because with any change there are short term shocks that can screw a few people over so we help them adjust.
ACLU does great work on some matters, but that doesn't mean they're always right. The act of spending money is not speech, and the government should be able to regulate it if it destroys the foundation of our democratic process.
Because they 'felt threatened'. You can do that now.

No, they are only concerned with their own careers, and what ties they can make to ensure their post-government career will be as lucrative as possible.     Greed knows no boundaries. 
meaning ?  r u implying NAFTA has helped the blue collar workers?... no way... ya money was made, but not by the people who bought into the whole "it creates more jobs for everyday folks"......

But it has also cost many U.S. manufacturing workers their livelihoods while failing to raise living standards for most Mexicans.""  http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/north-american-free-trade-agreement.asp
&gt;  There is a sizeable portion of the population that wants to make a living wage doing menial work, and isn't going to become a part of any service economy or turn into an entrepreneur overnight. The lost jobs are needed.   That's exactly what this assistance is for, people can't change overnight so we'll help them transition into the new economy.

Without knowing more, it sounds like you could have accomplished the same level of security with pepper spray.  Using that instead, you wouldn't risk the accidents associated with owning a gun.  
If the entire labor source is gone, then demand should should also be gone. 
lol, make that 100...and still counting apparently.
I imagine there will be efforts to make new space colonies for regulation-free cheap materials extraction and goods production. Then either government or corporate ownerships bodies will place taxes, duties, tarriffs and price hikes on those colonies. American colonies all over again, minus violence with displaced natives (probably).
LOL the title is "NAFTA Problems"
&gt; The act of spending money is not speech  The act of spending money is not abortion, either.  Does that mean the State of Mississippi could legally prohibit spending money on abortions?  If you ban spending money on speech (or abortion) then you are indeed restricting speech (or abortions).
For the same reason we shouldn't be [luddites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite).  A small segment of population will be adversely affected in the short term, but in the long run, we all benefit with lower prices and new jobs (and new goods and services) that take the place of older ones.

Actually a simple expiration of the Patriot Act isn't that great since a number of the provisions within it were given with expiration, so letting the law expire will not stop certain parts of it, they actually need to introduce a bill to override parts of the act or renew it with modifications removing specific pieces for many of the more controversial parts of it to be stopped.
I just read an article today about a charitable group that wanted to give Bill Clinton an award for his foundation work. He turned them down 3 times. Then it was "suggested" that the charitable group make a donation to the Clinton Foundation if they wanted him to appear. $500,000 minimum.   They made the donation and Bill showed up. That's what the Clintons are all about. Money.  Hillary will make a great President, won't she?

aside from the concerns with expanding the welfare system even more and the impossibility of rolling back these kind of programs..  subsidies always cost more than they are worth to the consumer. a ten dollar subsidy per customer may very well cost multiples of that when it's said and done. the rest goes to the ISP. granted, i don't have any numbers at this time, but without a doubt this is more of a handout to the providers than it is help for families.  there are already major concerns with how ISPs operate, why would we want to get even more entangled with them. rewarding a company for failure to provide service at fair market rates isn't going to fix anything. any subsidy to comcast would be reinforcing their market dominance through government interference. does that sound familiar?

The problem is that "more efficiently" usually means "by paying super low wages." 
that would be true, if the entire labor force were gone.  but there is little reason to expect trade agreements to hurt the total amount of jobs available in the us.  nafta is often accused of being a job killer, however that accusation is curious going by [this chart of total us jobs going back to 1990](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1bn3).  nafta went into effect on january 1, 1994.  job creation was fairly robust for the rest of the 90s.
Fresh breath of air in this thread...
The corporate media w ill ignore him and demean him at their own peril. In a public debate Hillary doesn't stand a chance....she has too much baggage and Bernie is sharp as a tack.  Edit: Peril is the wrong word I was looking for - but they will try top paint him in the same light as a Ron Paul or Ross Perot crackpot - but this guy's got a solid track record and he has been a voice for the people for a long time but the media prefers to focus on nonsense and obstructionists yelling at each other to maintain the status quo. Obama torpedoed Hillary and this country is desperate for new leadership not a re-hash of the old by some $100 millionaires...
Copying the comments alone and not the entire conversation and context is disingenuous, I suspect you already know that.  Packs? Yeah, because 33% of the population is tired of being shit on by people who have **no idea** what they're talking about. Vicious? That's a little extreme, but people are certainly upset when people with the mentality of anti-vaxxers (feelings over facts) attack their *constitutional and human rights*.  "So many threats" you say. Does it really matter how often you encounter a threat? My house has never caught fire, but I sure as hell own fire extinguishers in case it does. I've never had my home broken into either, yet I own a firearm. **To protect myself and my loved ones.**  Responsible gun owner? Why yes, yes I am. Informing someone of the *facts* is the epitome of responsibility.   As to the G19 comment, I thought that was pretty obvious. You erroneously believe that firearms are inherently dangerous.  The fact that my holstered firearm, as well as millions of others, has never jumped up and shot anyone is pretty damning evidence that guns are only as dangerous as their owner.  So a gun hasn't saved your life (that you know of). Not having a gun certainly has never saved your life either. No one has ever looked at you and thought "hey that guy's unarmed, better not rob him". The only time a gun can put you at additional risk is if you're an idiot that advertises the fact you're carrying, which could possibly make you a target. Carrying concealed however only increase your safety, and in no way could ever be a detriment.  So you are scared then? Don't be. Calm people live, people who panic die.  And onto Aurora. My point was that the illusion of safety  (something you're clinging to) doesn't make you safe. I didn't say a damn thing about someone being armed helping, although it couldn't have hurt. The nature of the attack was cowardly and sudden, but *maybe* if a responsible owner had been carrying that day, they could have stopped that monster when his weapon malfunctioned and he had to clear the jam. Those precious moments could have been pivotal. But guess what? He *deliberately* targeted the Aurora theater because he knew the theater didn't allow firearms, and he knew he'd meet no opposition. Pretty damning evidence right there.  If you don't see the relevance in the statement about being attacked on the street, I'm not sure how I could possibly make it simpler. That's my bad.  So you claim to have been in the service, yet you're scared of guns? Lemme guess, desk jockey for the Air Force?  As for the next point, let me just say I don't believe you served at all.  Let's just say you could magically snap your fingers and all the guns would disappear. The world would enter an era of peace, right? Wrong. People would still kill, but instead of with quick pieces of lead, it would be skulls bashed in with bricks, people burnt alive with molotovs, folks hacked to pieces in the street with machetes. Just look at counties with strict gun laws like China, where some psycho killed a **dozen** people with a *fucking hatchet*. Because he was crazier, and stronger. Know what overpowers crazy and physical prowess 100% of the time? A 9mm.
Why would you care about how this affects the political environment? The man lost his son, which must be very painful. I think this is one of those moments where we should put politics aside pray for him and his family.
The difference between Palin and Huckabee is that Palin is just a brilliant, natural-born demagogue. She comes to her wild, outlandish positions and rhetoric through instinct.   While Huckabee is smarter, slicker but it doesn't come as naturally. Plus, he is over-compensating for having the temerity to actually govern and as a result having a complicated record.  It's George Wallace vs Richard Nixon.   
It's so bizarre that they're religion would influence decisions they make in life. Weird stuff indeed.
&gt; net gain is worth it.  ...for the small percentage of Americans who get to enjoy the net gain.   Fortunately, those are the people who pay Congressmen! 
Once again, keep talking yourself into this.  Use science and stats to help you justify an ugly modern death based on convenience.
&gt; why do you think its okay for the government to restrict a groups freedom of speech simply because that speech is dealing with politics? &gt; &gt; Because we are coming to realize that holding freedom up over all other things, even when its results are disastrous, is not actually a better idea than enacting some limits on how people in our society interact in order to keep from turning our nation into, ie, a slave state under the heel of billionaires and corporate interests.  How are we a slave state? You can't be serious right?  So you want people's freedoms to engage in speech taken away because?   &gt; , freedoms are good, but not when they hurt others.  this expression of free speech hurts everyone that isnt disgustingly wealthy.    How?   How does me and 5 of my buddies pulling money together to make an ad that says   "Vote for sanders"  How does that hurt anyone?   &gt; the actual solution to this, no, isn't to put arbitrary limits on free speech -- it's to break up wealth and end power dynasties and individual interests with enough power behind them to steer the course of the nation.    How do you break up wealth and power dynasties other than taking people's money away and their assets?   &gt; that isnt feasible in the short term, we need to be able to stop them from silencing the poor and completely undermining and overtaking the nation another way (ie, by telling them they can't sink all of their money into drowning out dissenting ideas.)   Is you ability to speak being stopped because the Koch brothers donated money to a PAC?
He voted yea for the USA freedom act last week. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/s194  Try again.
If everything was up to the people, this country would still be segregated.
Also, nobody seems to think that Russia or China would readily arm the guerilla side of a civil war in the States just to weaken the entire nation.
In other words trickle down economics, well that's just a euphemism for "give me your money now, let me pay you less for same or better productivity, and later on we'll pay you back if we feel like it."
So people can't attach amendments which would invalidate the entire thing since foreign nations would have to agree?
You know the kochs aren't going to spend 330 million of their own money right?
The mantra is always about not harming responsible gun owners, but you hold that if a gun owner makes a mistake and negligently harms another person all of the costs should fall on the person they hurt?  Like it is some huge burden on the gun owners too, you know that insurance protects the bearer as well correct? 
God, they are stupid. No knowledge on any topic, not even an elementary understanding, it's brutal. 
Just another way to suck wealth from the population through ponzi.

You're right I'm so happy being represented by the ignorant *minority* of old men in congress who don't understand technology or the future in general really.  The whole philosopher king thing only works **when such people actually exist**, which they clearly do not.  No human being is that smart or enlightened.  Yet.
Okay I stopped reading your argument after like the third time you told me nobody was making that argument. They are
I agree that prayer should not be forced in public school.  But giving subsidies to Christian schools does not violate the First Amendment.    The First Amendment says nothing about the separation of church and state.  It says that the government will not establish an official religion and that it will not prohibit the free exercise of religion.  
he's he forcing the expiration of the entire patriot act or just certain provisions?
Of course. Good luck defending 1 and 4 without 2.   Or do you think voting actually works? 
To be fair I was confused at first why Congress even had land with temples in south Asia to sell. 
Yes. He told secrets to the veitcong for better treatment. Asshole. 
It's cool man, we all make mistakes.  Just go read the OSHA guidelines and be satisfied that you learned something.
It is in the gospel of our Lord, Supply-Side Jesus. /s
&gt; I live in Utah and they have some similar laws here that hurt the working class.   None of those laws hurt the working class if employers don't treat employees that way, which is kind of my point.  I have customers in VA and UT and none of them do this kind of shit because it is bad business.
I think voting is a much better way to try to defend your civil liberties than shooting people, yes. Shooting or threatening to shoot the feds very rarely convinces them to go along with your ideas.
Well, I think there's a part in the old testament about putting rape victims to death...

If you are going to cite a study why would you provide a link to an ideologically biased group as opposed to a link to the actual study? You, like the group you cite to, have already made up your mind on which theory of political decisionmaking is most likely to explain policy making.   Believe it or not, there may be other people who do not need a middleman to interpret an academic study, and can actually read it on their own. Once presented with the paper the reader can determine if the authors methodology and operationalization of the variables appears valid. Additionally, they can look at the regression coefficients and r-squared values to see if the results are statistically significant, substantively meaningful, and whether the model is actually explaining the variance in the dependent variable.  You recommend people share that link with others. But, wouldn't it be more appropriate to share the link to the academic paper, which lacks the bias of the site? This way the reader can interpret the paper for themselves and not have it interpreted for them by a group with a motivation. For example, some may wonder how the article operationalizes an "average citizen" and an "elite."  Reading the article they can see that the authors define elite as an "economic elite," which is people who are in the 90th income percentile in 2012 dollar. They acknowledge that this group received "only about $146,000 in annual household income" (p. 568). An "average american" is defined as someone who is in the median-income bracket for household income. Are these two groups of people really that different in their policy beliefs? Table 2 of the paper shows that the data from both groups have a correlation of .78, which isn't very surprising. Additionally, there are questions here that implicate research on political knowledge, which usually finds that people with higher incomes tend to have a greater knowledge of politics. I would hope that Congress isn't making decisions based on the opinion of those with the least amount of political knowledge. This would be kind of scary. It's definitely an interesting article, but instead of trying to tell people *what* to think, maybe it would be more genuine to provide primary source (the academic paper) and let people use the literature to decide what to think themselves.   Gilens, Martin, and Benjamin I. Page. 2014. "Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens." *Perspective on Politics* 12(3): 564-81.
it's true they prefer to be called American-Americans
Then you are completely ignorant.   The vast majority of America opposes surveillance. Yet the majority of the government supports it.  Tell me again how your vote or opinion influences the government? They don't give a fuck about you. It's obvious. Open your eyes, after you pull your head out of your ass. Wouldn't want you to get pink eye.
But do they give people breaks?  That is what this post is about.
Kind of like the 10 million a minute in subsidies that the government hands out to the fossil fuel industry? 
&gt; In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Court drew on Founding Father Thomas Jefferson's correspondence to call for "a wall of separation between church and State", though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute.

I too was confused when I saw the title at first. 
&gt; The very fact that Congress had to create a program to help workers that lose their jobs from trade deals proves that they understand how disastrous deals like NAFTA and CAFTA and the TPP are for American workers.  Is this author serious?
But all those things are based on science, and you know how we feel about *that* stupid fad. 
Thanks I do my best.
There's a gradual shift. Is it an ideal system? No. Would taking up arms against the government be a very effective way to try to protest it? Not in the slightest. What's the success rate on trying to persuade the US government through armed rebellion? 0%?
Unless it's about Qatar.
Myopic? Myopic is thinking your own personal views are the objective truth, despite the fact that there are honest and intelligent people on both sides of major issues. People that don't agree with you are not bad, most of these issues are contentious and unsettled despite the fact that you know everything.
Enabling them is the moral hazard.  This is a problem SOLELY created by government involvement. Capitalism does not reward bad decisions and there is never such a thing as too big to fail.

our involvement was already on the down trend... and if it wasnt i would have been in the matter of months.
Yeah that's what I started doing, but a lot of people will allow themselves to be exploited without speaking up for fear of losing their jobs.
I bet you blame NAFTA when you get turned down by girls for a date to the prom. 
Again, you're ignorant. And I don't mean that as an insult. Wiki "vietnam" and "guerilla warfare", just for casual reading.  If the US populace had even a  mildly concerted effort against the government, it would be hilariously one sided. Like Mike Tyson versus an infant one sided.
&gt;Someone wasn't paying attention during econ 101 when they talked about comparative advantage.  China is the faster growing economics in the world and one of the most protectionist , just like the Asian tigers and South Korea were protectionists during their booms , the US has something like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1816), the UK empire relied heavy on imperialism/colonialism etc  Free trade and comparative advantage can be good, but the idea they are always good for all party involved is basically a dogma and some arguments are even accepted by economists  nonetheless their bias for free trade  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_industry
No, I haven't seen that but it doesn't surprise me.   You know, it's funny because Feinstein is no less batshit insane than Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee, but guess who gets all the negative media coverage? If a Republican introduced the **exact same bill** I bet it would be front page news. /r/politics would be frothing at the mouth on a daily basis, and the relevant Senator would become a household name within a week.   The media never asks Democrats "gotcha!" questions like they love to do with Republicans and issues like climate change or abortion. 
What, do you honestly think that the US is likely to stand up against the government in a manner comparable to the Vietnam War? America doesn't care *nearly* that much about something like surveillance, which is a big part of why there aren't many candidates who stand against it. 
Yes that's why i prefer a socialist style economy and not a capitalist one. The workers, the people, should be in control of the means of production and not a wealthy owning class. A socialist market is no less free than a capitalist market, the difference is only in how business is run and organized.   I think you confuse what i want as a state run economy. While nationalization of industry may be necessary for a short period of time to transition to a worker controlled business model, the state should not maintain control indefinitely as what happened in the USSR.
Yeah. But the repubtards are so evil they stop him from doing anything! /s
You're reasons are REALY tinfoil hat. The reason we haven't colonized Mars is because we haven't seen a good enough reason to, yet. You say we have to expand to save our economy, and you may be right, but not enough people agree with you and see an upside to pursue the idea. It's not a cover up, and people are acting rationally when they don't "pony up the dough" because there is no private entity that can afford to pony up that kind of dough, and no nation sees it as worthwhile. 
what is that supposed to mean? Average American citizens are of all types
You asked who owned those politicians. Several are being bankrolled by the Koch brothers. 
You know, I've thought about this argument a bit lately, and it makes a strongly convincing point.  But I've begun to wonder: is that really an accurate portrayal of what it would be like if the 2nd Amendment were somehow limited or repealed?  It just seems so over simplistic and ignorant of current solutions to that very issue.  There are countless countries which do not currently recognize the right to bear arms.  Are they experiencing this scenario you described?  In many cases, yes.  Yet in a significant amount of others, no; the people are still as safe if not safer than in the U.S.  I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying here, I'm just saying that I'm questioning this line of reasoning.  Personally, I think the answer is indeed the freedom to keep and bear arms.  Its just that a well educated populace wielding those arms is much better than a poorly educated one.  Is there anyone on either side of the debate that wouldn't like to see education provide the solution to gun violence?
That's what I mean, what's the problem?
Who then? It wasn't the comment you replied to. It wasn't my comments. 
For Hillary: She's the classic big money candidate who is being bought by big corporations. She's also quite moderate in my opinion.   For Sanders: I agree with Sanders on quite a lot of things, it's just I agree with O'Malley more and how he goes about it. I think his whole CityStat and StateStat style programs can work if they're applied nationwide. Also with Sanders I'm just not fully convinced by him. This may just be me not reading enough news (entirely possible, if it is please correct me), but all I hear from his camp is all about the "grassroots movement" and rallying support to the cause, not what he'd do and how he'd do it. It appears to me as if he thinks he has no chance at winning which is disappointing.   This is all opinion though so many will disagree with me.
Most citizens don't have the qualifications to understand that a trade agreement will strip away jobs and rights from them? Are we all in kindergarten? 
"One court out of ninety four district courts, not a lawmaker, and not a governor or president pulled the movie because of a misuse of an unrelated case."  You don't have a problem with this?   I want Michael Moore locked up.  I hate him with a passion.  There are lots of people like me who vote for people like me.  Why would I vote for any politician that doesn't want Moore locked up??  You seem to forget that the whole point of the Bill of Rights is to protect people like Moore from people like me.  Your rewrite to the constitution will remove those protections.  All you need is enough Republicans in state legislatures.. Oh, we have 2/3rds of that already!  You seem to think everyone in government is an angel and would never try to silence dissenting speech (I'm winking at you Lois Lerner). 
NAFTA shot his mom and raped his dog.  He's probably never been to within 200 miles of a border city, let alone visited one or Mexico itself.   The mequilidoras are not the greatest things things in the world, but far superior to raking dirt in the Chihuahuan desert.  Many Mexicans are finding advancement.  They have more of a government issue than anything else, just like us.        Globalization is going to continue to grow and artificial tariffs are and always have been fucking stupid and hurtful towards the consumer.  We built a fucking nation to stand against that shit. The worst that can happen is you trade more low paid manufacturing jobs for high waged service economy jobs.  But about the only thing we make in the US is oil field parts, weapons, and cars.  Mercedes and Hyundai aren't about to give up their investments.  Toyota USA and its Kentucky and San Antonio plants are here to stay.  
No, I don't. No one (sadly) is going to stand up until shit hits the fan.   But very soon, every class, race, religion, and creed is going to feel the strain. It's already happening. The middle class is failing while being acutely aware of the upper classes continuing to make billions. Talk to people. Everyone from the most liberal hippie to the most die-hard redneck is fed up. In this age of information, where everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, more and more people, even the outliers and the ignorant, are waking up to reality. People are tired of being serfs to the kings, kings that can't even maintain their stance.  The nation is headed into either civil strife, or 1984. I sincerely hope it's the former.

Keep on telling yourself that.
People, please refrain from breaking the circlejerk.  We need more protectionist tariffs, just let the ones we formed the US to avoid.
You know...I never liked the way the US govt has historically treated Native Americans. I mean currently reservations are full of poverty, casinos, meth, alcoholism, crime, prostitution, obesity, and every year the land shrinks. Now a days the vast majority of Native reservations are cess pits. There was a way to avoid this...  The US govt with it's superior army should have outright conquered/slaughtered/enslaved the Natives. The defeated peoples would then eventually be given a choice, integration or death/imprisonment. All of the too proud troublemakers would be taken care of with option 2, while the majority would join the melting pot that is American Society. The first couple decades would have been rough, just like with Africans, Asians, Irish, etc... But today everyone lives together and equality laws make sure of that. All of these people have terribly rough starts, but eventually it all evens out. And this hasn't only happened in the US. Just look at the Aztecs, they don;t live in reservations, the Spanish fucked them and turned them into Mexicans. And Mexicans are proud to be Mexican, they don't hold centuries worth of resentment for that. When a new Aztec ruin is discovered it doesn't open old wounds, it's a cause of celebration for the rediscovery of ancient culture. And that is how we should have handled American Natives!  Think about it. No more poverty stricken, crime filled, drug and alcohol flooded reservations. No more of this sacred land nonsense where people pick fucking acorns for Christ sake. Fucking Acorns, who gives a shit.   Natives would have the same rights as the rest of Americans, would live scattered across white communities hold down jobs or fester in ghettos on benefits, their choice, just like the other races have. Most would have mixed with the locals and and their decedents would pretty much be tan white Americans, the ones that want to keep their culture alive would abstain from race mixing and join NAdate.come or some bullshit, and worship in temples scattered across the US. By literally treating Natives like any other fucking immigrant their quality of lives would have been vastly improved by now. Instead they got special treatment due to white guilt, and now their people and culture slowly rots away in a haze of fire water and meth. By trying really fucking hard to not be racist America fucked over the natives big time. Instead if they just suspended their morals for a bit longer the suffering of a few for a bit would have allowed the many to prosper for ages.  Most of you wont like this line of thought, you'll say it's racist and insensitive. But that is the reality of history, it is fucking brutal. Being overly sensitive sentenced a people to a steady decline with deep resentment for America. We all would have been better off if the founding fathers had the balls to handle the situation like the Spanish, or the Portuguese south of the continent.  
There should be a maximum age to be in congress. Like... 30.
There has been literally no terrorist act caught because of the patriot act: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/fbi-admits-patriot-act-snooping-powers-didnt-crack/?page=all  Your argument that weak arguments don't last is laughable, and dishonest plenty of good arguments are actively punished by ridicule and the interest of the super rich the drug war is a fantastic example of this.   If you don't know what [The Intercept](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/05/28/anonymous-fear-mongering-patriot-act-nyt-wh/) is then you shouldn't involve yourself in this conversation because you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.  https://www.aclu.org/how-usa-patriot-act-redefines-domestic-terrorism 
No.
Gladly:                1. First let's understand that there is no such thing as a soul because the evidence *FOR* it is zero. Zero. It is a Stone Age Myth, it has no definition, and it has no evidence to support it. So, quite simply, that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.                  2. As someone who studies ancient history and mythology, explain to me how your idea of a "soul" differs from the Ka and Ba of the ancient Egyptians. If a "soul" is only about life, then why do they (and other cultures) assert that inanimate objects have what you would call a "soul"? Or are we just going to pretend those cultures don't exist because you have (without evidence) already dismissed their beliefs since it wasn't what you were brainwashed into as a child?                  3. We know what causes thought, the ancients did not. The concept of the "soul" (which far predates your religion), largely started as a discussion about human thought and consciousness. However, in the modern world, we know what causes thought. It is the interaction of chemicals and electrical impulses in the brain, brain stem, spine, and (to some degree) stomach. That's your "soul", basic neurology. Or are we going to assume that people who knew less about the universe than the most ignorant of first graders managed to dream up the right answer with nonsense like a "soul"? Do you also want to talk about whether "humours" are real? Hmmmmm? Didn't think so.                So what we have is Mesolithic or Neolithic mythology (What you would call the Stone Age). So we have Stone Age mythology from people so ignorant that a literal child today has more knowledge than they ever could hope for about the natural world. Their nonsense explanation for human thought (and their deep fear of death) drive them to create the idea of a "soul" and here you sit, 12,000 years later, so afraid of death that you cling to their nonsense. And you want "proof" it isn't real, while asserting none?                     Prove to me leprechauns aren't real, because that's the level of discussion we're at right now.                     &gt;It's mainly where does the soul begin, not actual brain thinking/heart beating life.               What hilarious nonsense. "Where do the Humors begin and not actual germs and illness?"                   If I hit you in the head with a hammer and turn you into a serial killer did I hit your soul too hard? Did I break your soul? Did your soul take a hammer to its "goodness"? Or did your brain suffer damage and alter your behavior? Yeah, thought so. But we're to believe that when you suffer brain death you magically turn into a Stone Age myth and live ever more! How quaint.               Here it's said far more elegantly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juriylw7B0g            Everything you are is your brain activity. Everything. The idea of the "soul" is a pre-modern concept to explain thought. But we now know that thought exists because of the cerebrum. Let go of Stone Age mythology. 
You have literally no idea what you are talking about.
&gt; Ok, I'll bite. In Constitutional law, we apply something called *strict scrutiny  I like this reply already: anytime someone brings up strict scrutiny, I get a boner   &gt; determine if a particular infringement of a fundamental right (like freedom of speech) is justified. If a proposed action violates a fundamental right, it must pass strict scrutiny in order to be upheld.    Correct  &gt; Strict scrutiny has three prongs which must be satisfied: The proposed action must be motivated by a compelling state interest It must be narrowly tailored so as to only target the necessary things to achieve the compelling state interest. It must employ the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling state interest.   Correct: this was made very evident in the hobby lobby case. So far we are in agreement on everything   &gt; say that a restriction on corporate speech, contra Cit. United, can pass the three prongs of strict scrutiny.   If you can make that argument, id love to see it   &gt; First, and in my opinion, most importantly, it passes the first prong: Ensuring the legitimacy of elections is certainly a compelling state interest. Further, even if excessive corporate speech doesn't result in inequitable elections the fact that, overwhelmingly, public opinion is that it does (See Stevens's dissent) supports a compelling state interest to foster public confidence in the legitimacy of elections. There are additional arguments for why restrictions on corporate speech can satisfy the first prong of strict scrutiny, but I think these will do for now.   I like this argument but it's a faulty one at best. First I wana say thank you for actually engaging in a legal way.  Strict scrutiny asks that a compelling state interest must be in play: here you and Stevens (as per dissent) are arguing that the integrity of the electoral process is the interest  But this argument fails to see that the integrity of this process also requires a free exercise of speech and a free marketplace of ideas   You cannot protect the integrity of an electoral process which is simply an election of people and their visions and ideologies by restricting the free exercise and promotion of ideas.   Also such measures transfer power to speech that it does not have. Speech is a truly negative right, you have the right to speak, but not the right to be heard.   The state interest of protecting the integrity of elections must also protect the integrity of the free marketplace of ideas   Because if not of these ideas and these men and women who hold and represent these ideas: then what is being decided?  &gt; As for the second and third prongs, I think that we can definitely achieve restrictions which are narrowly tailored and least restrictive, but if you disagree I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.   I agree the system isn't perfect, but restrictions brought forth must not infringe on fundamentL rights such as speech  
I had to look up that term to be honest, but from what I have read about the TPP is that if countries have laws protecting workers they can be sued for it if it interferes with future profits. Same for laws protecting the environment. There are going to be many external costs when this is put into place, and I suspect the practical outcomes will be over all negative unless you are a politician or a member of the ruling class (rich enough to buy politicians).
If we apply your logic to any crime, say theft, then because we cannot COMPLETELY eliminate theft it's useless to try. Then why have laws at all? People will always break the law, that does not mean that we should not take a stand against things that are wrong.
You are only demonstrating the enormity of your own ignorance.
And you forgot to mention that our Military definitely would NOT war against the people it's sworn to protect. Maybe some brainwashed soldiers would, but it wouldn't be very many. 
I think its pretty logistically impressive that they got all 1100 people from across the country that are going to vote for him to congregate in the same place at the same time. 
&gt; honestly don't care about them &gt; &gt; honestly care about students and the future of the United States.  I would like it if students could get a college education, and when finished, be able to borrow money for an entrepreneurial venture - which they would not be as likely to be able to do if they are $120,000 or $200,000 in debt.  Ok: cool   Who would give them this loan?  &gt; I'm going to guess that makes sense.  It's irrelevant to the original topic, but yet your intentions made sense   &gt; Im sorry i really dont get the point you are making here or why you turn it into a partisan issue &gt; &gt; I think I've asked this before: why should higher education be a "partisan" issue?  I certainly didn't make it one.  I didn't decrease funding continually from nearly 70% of operating expenses to around 6%, forcing students to finance current research.   But these people who I discussed (the ones you claim you don't care about) have pushed this ... and made it a "partisan" issue.    Ok  &gt; Why?  Who knows.  I'm sure there is someone who does, but I don't think even Scott Walker can or will tell you.  I don't care if he does or doesn't   
I graduated not too long ago as a business major, they don't talk about comparative advantage until international business, which is a senior level class that only business majors take. Not an Econ 101 class that the Lit majors have to droop the foam from their mouths on the test to pass. Invariably someone comes in and links to a wikipedia page and suddenly they're an expert on a subject. I spent six hours with a jackass professor from India spouting out buzzwords like "comparative advantage" and I still don't think *I* have a great handle on the subject.   The purpose of tariffs are to promote goods produced locally. Surely they covered *that* in your econ 101 class. It creates local jobs and stimulates the domestic economy. This is good and bad. The bad is that it makes whatever they produce more expensive. The good is that it creates jobs. It makes it so you don't have to compete domestically with countries that *do* have a comparative advantage.   If you don't have tariffs, the money you spend on those goods trading with a country that produces them cheaply leaves the country. Do you understand that? The money leaves our country and goes to theirs. How does paying another country help our economy? What are we going to trade them in return? Stock information? This service industry bullshit people spout that they think the US economy is becoming is garbage. We have a service industry. We have minimum wage slaves who serve our economic elites coffee, food, clean their streets, fix their cars and homes, and protect them while they sleep. We need to desperately work on our industrial jobs and exports of goods instead of trying to fix how we import goods. 
&gt; The way I stated it is a correct and exact summation of the issue.  Quote it.  You may have and you may not.  To adjudge, you should place what ever it is you say is "correct and exact" (I seriously doubt it) in a quote so we can look at it.  &gt;Thankfully we have justices on the bench, much smart ether than you or I  The mystic is gone, destroyed as Scalia fell to Leslie Stahl like Kasperov to Deep Blue.   He looked like a tool.  As did Alito when he could not admit there is no limit and that he erased it.   If you have a problem with anything I said, quote it.  &gt;That their decision conflicts with liberal censorship bothers you in a way amuses me greatly.  An imputed accusation.  Leave the word "you" and "bother" out of it please.  Probably you should also leave out liberal and censorship as well.    A corporation is a commercial entity created and regulated by Congress.  They can do anything they want with it.  Alito ultimately has no say and clearly has no understanding of the issue.
Did Republicans destroy another one?

The necessary foundations for a conscious mind do not develop until the third trimester. Unless the scientific consensus is completely backwards and the capacity for joy, suffering, learning, and intellect exists in the toenails and heart that pro-lifers won't shut up about,  there's simply not enough brain or brain-like nervous system in any second-trimester fetus to suppose that it is a person.
Meanwhile the other side of the fence is give the poor everything they need without requiring a job. Let the middle class pay for it. Mega wealthy still suck up the wealth. It's all the same thing, stop thinking one party is more concerned for the poor than the other. It's all vote pandering and anyone who isn't at the top is still getting screwed.   On the subject at hand, damn it you idiots, the Internet helps everyone. In today's age it's needed by everyone. Assholes playing into the stereotype of the republicans make me face palm. 
Yeah I do, which is why most of them flee these shit holes.  And yes most of them are in fact shitty for various reasons.  Compare rape rates and violent crime rates in these places to outside, it's really bad and we need to do something.  They still live here, they're still citizens and the children being born there have the right to live a better life.  Not a 3rd world life where most girls are raped by the age of 14 and most of them never finish HS.   
That's a pretty misleading map. Looking at the original article he doesn't seem too extreme. Also if by the last few years you mean the past 2 decades you are right.   Salivating:  * Afghanistan: We did invade  * Iraq: Ditto  * Syria: In response to the civil war and there is a large portion of Americans that support an intervention there.  * Libya: Related to the civil war there where once again some Americans did support military intervention.  Serious:  * Nigeria: He wanted to have a special ops team rescue the girls kidnapped by Boko Harem. Not exactly an invasion.  * Iran: Someone asked him when we would "send an airmail message to iran" and he responded "It's that old Beach Boys song, 'Bomb Iran'? Bomb bomb bomb…". He didn't call for invasion but to be honest there is a large degree of tension between the Iran and the US.  I won't go into the rest but honestly if you compile everything that a political figure has said over the past 2 decades and take everything that can vaguely be misconstrued as an invasion as a serious desire to invade then I feel like there are many other figures who would create much more worrying maps.
Thanks
Easy answer.  Every dictatorship started with taking away guns.  When criminals have guns and people don't you get Mexico, Somalia, etc.
I said most were, you then asked if all = most.  If most of them are 3rd world hellholes we have an obligation to do something.  Not let them fester in poverty to protect their culture, which btw is degrading faster than any other culture in the US.  People come to the US all of the time and keep their culture in one way or another, native culture is degrading very fast because of the poverty/crime.
Good.  Taxpayers shouldn't pay for non-essentials through taxes or hidden fees on our cable or cell phone bill.  You don't need internet to survive.  It's not the job of government to make sure you're properly entertained in the comfort of your home/trailer/motel/cardboard box. There are plenty of free public hot spots and the library that has internet and computers available to the public and schools of course have computer labs and the school library which are available after school hours for a period of time. 
Sorry about that dude being such an asshole.
There are bad things about the TPP, but this is the stupidest takedown of it that I have read.  Free trade causes some job loss and creates others, just like any other change in the economy.  So the fact that we know it will cause some job loss is disasterous? The author clearly has no knowledge of basic economic thery and should just go read the choice about 12 times because all it does is pound this one point into your head.   Paying for it with medicare, yes being against that is a valid argument.
I can't speak for my colleagues but the new page is where I tend to live, not just here but on many subreddits since it has the stories that may not garner as many upvotes be better, as well as stories that may not fit the rules of the sub but are still a good read. Here though, that means removing them if they don't fit our rules.
Yes that is, usually they will say from the Associated Press or "originally posted by." For non-AP rehosting often it will be the more informal "hat tip [source]" or "h/t [source]". If in doubt, you can [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpolitics) and we'll take a look.

If you are going to regret voting for someone every time they fail to have a 100% success rate you might want to consider not voting anymore.  I would vote for him a third time considering what the alternative is.
Free-markets are not cheap. Economic systems cost money and are really just a form of allocating resources. All of the rules that are made up and enforced determine who gets what. Taxation is just part of the rule system that allows people to have wealth in the first place.  It is like a penalty in a sports game. Nobody likes them, but without them there are no rules that allow anyone to play in the first place.
You can read chapters of the trade agreement on Wikileaks. No matter how bad this source is, they're completely right. The TPP is awful. Anyone who reads those chapters and says they agree and thinks it would improve anything is corrupt. There's simply no other way. That's how bad they are. No joke. Edit: because people are responding without having bothered to actually check out the agreement: https://wikileaks.org/tpp-enviro/
How is that possible? There are tens of millions more people in Canada.
sshhh don't interrupt the /r/politics republican circlejerk 
Being a POW and being tortured doesn't make you less of an asshole, and if that's the only thing making him worthy of respect, maybe he's not a terribly respectable person.
They don't? I know a right wing website like reddit still pretends it's a joke but your party has long admitted their only goal is to obstruct Obama. 
And those people benefit the most when the economy is in good shape. I doubt corporations would intentionally hurt the economy. That's bad for everyone including them.
Mitt Romney is an idiot. It makes me uncomfortable to think how close you republicans brought us to WW3. No one is giving Obama a blanket pass. He gets plenty of criticism over TPP, Obamacare, and the Patriot Act here. The problem with right wing websites like reddit is that you won't be happy until there is nothing left but hate for that man.   Most Americans can see past his black skin. For all the mistakes he made Obama has done plenty things right too. To /r/politics that makes me a liberal shill, but then half of the country must be shills. 
Why do you think the government should be able to ban certain types of advertisements? And what's your standard for what can be banned. 
Because the guy is fucking nuts dude, I don't get whats so hard about this to understand.  The economic policy he wants would cripple this country beyond belief.  He is not sane.  He's just another bat-shit crazy Libertarian that doesn't live in the real world.
Why can't Obama just take executive action and force it?
When's the last time someone who wasn't a dickhead ran against one of the dickheads, dickhead?
The problem is they're taking the money from medicare and using it on an unrelated program. Otherwise I agree there's no other problems with an assistance program except maybe effectiveness.
The US conquered both Afghanistan and Iraq pretty thoroughly.  What it failed to do is stick around and build effective democracy.  
Yep! That one.
lol reverse reality
Numerous advisors and politicians have pointed out that the secrecy around the TPP is exceptional compared to the secrecy around NAFTA.
Then how would you campaign? 
Actually, we just need to stop corruption of the political process by special interests.  100% of our problems extend from there, climate denial included.
How do his jokes keep going over your head lol :p

I really just want a Democrat to make a press release that's literally just "Fuck you."
This needs to be at the top. Please everyone we need to remember Rand Paul is an incredibly scary "if u black stay back .. IF ur brown stay down, .if you white though your all right" ultra-libertarian who is just too extreme to be taken seriously
Uh, kind of a long bow to draw there. We might need a little more evidence before we jump on board with the "NAFTA caused drug cartels" conclusion.
No. Dude, just no  Rand Paul's dangerous extremist "white"-ring philosophy affects and permeates everything he does. He and his Republican extremist super-libertarian ilk are simply far too extreme to be taken seriously. This has EVERYTHING to do with the subject at hand. 
Guantanamo is open because Congress passed a law blocking funding for moving anyone out. In spite of that Obama *has* been trying to get non-dangerous detainees sent to other countries.  The ACA sets a limit on the percent profit insurers can make on a person. It has saved the lives of poor and sick people who otherwise wouldn't be able to get coverage.  It isn't everything liberals, but it is the most that *a couple conservative* Democrats in the Senate would agree to.
"All parties are the same" is a false equivalence false narrative pushed forward by people who want to ignore only one party is racist; only one party wants to imprison and kill the poor; only one party steals to give there rich buddies even more money; ect ect ect. The two parties are anything but the same

You assuming that people don't know what's best for them is appalling. 
But this isn't about trade. At all. This is a corporate blowjob and it screws Americans and strips away our rights and we never asked for it. We should all be pissed and protesting and it should be on the front page of every newspaper. This is outrageous. It shreds the constitution. They have no right to do that. Fuck corporations.   I want ethical companies.  And strong laws to keep them ethical. Other countries do this. 
Eh. Hard to care about apache holy land. 
&gt;That's your problem. You're either for free speech or you're against it. There are no "buts."   I am in favor of free speech.  But giving someone money as a bribe is simply not free speech.  &gt;Bribery is already illegal.  As I just explained, the Supreme Court (mistakenly, in my view) re-defined "bribery" in such a narrow way that most bribery doesn't fall under their definition.     In reality, bribery isn't just legal, we've made it basically manditory.  If you want to have a buisness in the US, you have to bribe politicians.  If you can't afford to bribe politicians, like if you're a small business, then the tax code will work against you and in favor of the large businesses who can.  And if you're a politician, you're required to accept bribes, and to act in such a way as to encourage people to give you more bribes.      &gt;You seem reasonable (a bit long winded) but do you think that banning speech will actually get rid of bribery? I think it will make it worse.   Nobody's talking about "banning speech".  What we're talking about is regulating and setting some limits on actually giving money to politicians (or, indirectly, to their super-PACS).  You haven't actually made an argument as to why handing someone a bag of money in exchange for "access" should be considered "speech" and not "bribery".        When bribery is illegal, it still happens occasionally, but it's not that common, and politicians who take illegal bribes are frequently caught and prosecuted.   The real problem is when it becomes systematic.   
Seems fair to me. All men created equal and all. 
Believe it or not, I actually do own a little thing of pepper spray as well as a hand taser, a 9mm pistol, and a sog knife.   I've tested the pepper spray out in an empty field against a paper plate (wind direction accounted for) and it's underwhelming to say the least. It's stopping power against one assailant is questionable, against multiple assailants is a bad joke.  The hand taser makes a lot of cracking noise, but I have nothing to test it on. Definitely attention grabbing, but it's a close quarter weapon and I'd rather not have to get that close.  My knife is just because it's the south and everyone carries a knife of one sort or another. It comes in very handy as a utility tool more than anything else. In a fight I'm not sure how effective it would be. Intimidating sure, but against multiple assailants it only takes one to grab my wrist and I'm done.  My 9mm pistol I've put quite a few rounds through at the range. I'm ex military and firearm training was mandatory. I stood ship and pier watch many nights. I'm a decent shot but won't be winning competition awards.   Now that my male muscle mass has significantly diminished while on medication for transitioning, I'm considering selling off my 9mm and buying a smaller caliber pistol instead. Something with less kick for sure. My shot spread has noticeably gotten a bit worse. I'm not strong enough anymore to hold the pistol steady and firm as I used to.   Maybe a .22 pistol would work for me.
Either I hope there are no black people in Iowa or Bernie figures out how to get them to come out and vote for him.
Of course it's congress' fault, and not that other guy.
You can't be a proper hypocrite without first being a Republican.
The simple and brute-force solution is to draft your favorite neighbor or yourself. Participation is everything. You don't need to wait for some national organization to choose for you - choose for yourself.

They don't.  He's just single minded.
&gt;Am I ok with reasonable restrictions to free speech similar to those that already exist? Yeah. I am  So you're OK with government censorship.  You're the only person that has answered the fucking question.    Jesus Christ that took forever.    I'll have an open debate about how evil it is to censor speech.  If you want to have it.  But thank you for answering honestly.  Everyone else is pretending like they're in an Aaron Sorkin political drama that entails grandiose words like, Democracy!  You're different, you actually think a human right should be debated because that human right might make you feel offended.    Everyone else just obfuscates their beliefs behind silly mantra's they've seen on television or the internet.

Is this what it has come to? Is this the type of material we need on the front page of /r/politics?  "BREAKING NEWS: People Attend Speech By Presidential Candidate!!"  The fact that garbage like this makes it to the front page is a sad reflection on the sub. 
&gt;It was the "will of the people" that sentenced these people to death in the first place. Those sentences of death didn't happen in a vacuum.  ... They also didn't happen in a voting booth... 
I honestly think the US should just be honest take all the land get rid of reservations and give every member of the remaining tribes millions. The current setup does nothing to protect them.
Bullshit, and crap like this is designed to help the very oligarchs youre talkin bout. Convenient that low voter turnout helps the party looking to give taxcuts to the superwealthy. Convenient that voter suppression targets low income, minority, likely democrat votes. Youre either a schill or a sucker if you really believe this
One of us should knock up the other, because I love you.
Rand Paul is the only serious candidate in the race who will actually work to shut this type of shit down. Say whatever you want about the guy, but his stance on the 4th Amendment and government surveillance, **and the fact that he is willing to do something about it**, is exactly why we need him in office.
&gt; Nobody's talking about "banning speech".  We're talking about banning movies about Hilary Clinton. The government actually argued before the Supreme Court that they could ban books if they wanted to.  You're advocating banning speech.  It polls well, but you're going to fail.  
So how is your firearm protecting you against warrantless wiretapping, unlimited political spending by billionaires, and the growing police state? Firearms may have been enough to keep a tyrannical government in check two hundred years ago, but they'd be worthless against carriers, tanks, drones, etc.
Oh like the rest of you are?
God help you lol
Yes, absolutely. The White House should veto it and make a public statement, "We have fucked Native Americans too many times in the name of profit and security. It was stupid and immoral of Senator McCain to try to sneak in a last-minute deal to destroy sacred Apache land. We've taken enough from them already, so we won't stand for this bullshit.  P.S. Don't wait until the last minute to pass important legislation--and if you do, don't add stupid shit like this. Wankers."

These days, that position just means you are first in line to rob that bureaucracy of its funds.  
You are wrong. There are so many weapons a government can use on it's people that aren't kinetic, that it wouldn't be like that. Asset  freezes, preemptive arrests, electronic warfare, limiting economic prospects etc. And you best believe if the U.S. military ever turned on it's people, they would believe whoever they are fighting is in the wrong. The U.S. military is inherently conservative and would never operate against Americans unless they believed they were a threat to the constitution. The scenario you outline would be accurate if a FOREIGN military invaded the U.S.. in that case, we would fuck them up
As long as retarded americans keep lining up to elect them because they want to stick one to the liberals......what cha gonna do?
Yeah, except I've given you a reason for why the guy is incompetent and crazy.  His economic policy would destroy this country in multiple ways.  It isn't a game.  It isn't made up.  He is a loon, a flat out run of the mill loon.  Prove me wrong, tell me how his economic policy isn't crazy.  Thank god most rational people see how bat-shit libertarians are or I'd be worried.
You can see an agenda for in Sunday mornings. For whatever reason Sunday morning seems to be when talking points are either rehashed or introduced. Anyway you can see abnormalities, like this, 387 upvotes, 31comnents, posted between 12 and 1 am EST. 
The university can still incorporate tenure into its employment policy.  Edit: For the down voters who didn't read the article. It says in the article they are going to incorporate it into their policies.
Yes, and all people are equal. Some are more equaler than others.
Jesus...
Facts, sure. But this is the same silly argument I see when I hear about Obama being the only president to ever use drones. Yes, because we all know Lincoln had tons of drones on tap, but chose to not use them. I mean, get real, we are in a rapidly moving society right now.  And while you are absolutely right about Obama breaking the campaigning records, you do realize the 2016 candidates from both parties will raise more, right? By a lot. And in 2020, they will break the record again. And 2024, etc. You get the picture.
Im not defending him, but one thing to add:  Alacarte might not actually be the best for cable.  When you bundle, you can put an unproven channel or show In with a very popular channel, so that you still have viewership on the package, and can take the risk on the new channel that perhaps everyone will hate.  This is how we get new things, instead of just the same shows following the same recipe over and over again.  Carriers can offer crazy new things that might be revolutionary, If it's bundled with a gauranteed revenue stream.

I kid you not, Ive seen the media snub this kind of thing because they arent spending thousands to be there. Sanders supporters can be percieved as a little out there I guess?
Kill it Rand, this is where you get unlimited support from civil rights persons.
He compromised himself and then made it worse by lying under oath. I can't disagree.
Wow an astounding total of 1100 people showed up to hear the old goat wax poetic on the political ideology invented by Karl Marx in the 1800s. How cute.  Save us Bernie! Save us from capitalism!
You do realize that pools, pets, and power equipment require insurance right?
Food for thought: The NRA is also funded by non-billionaire members - through dues which they voluntarily give to the organization....  
To all professors or soon to be professors:  Ban UW.  Do not teach at this school.  Let it go the way of the Conservative Party, right into the trash.  Let them fail and let Wisconsin continue to fail until it hurts.  If you are a professor there now, start looking elsewhere and show them what happens when conservatives denigrate and destroy something as important as education.  Wisconsin is starting to look more like Oklahoma every day.  How embarrassing.
&gt; Using something that is supposed to identify wrongful discharge of weapons etc as justification is a cover up, it literally covers up a wrong doing. You also didn't just simply say they use it to provide justification you said it is a cursory attempt at justification instead of a very critical investigation.  That is wrong.  You don't seem interested in understanding what I'm saying, only reinforcing your previously held opinions.  No need to argue about it.
Try to get homeowners insurance and not pay extra for a pool, power tools, or pets.
That may have been their motivation, but they couldn't have done it if he hadn't committed perjury. In fact, I don't think adultery is a crime at all?
That's kind of the point.  If you're looking to attract people with those skills to Wisconsin, it's kind of dumb to make policies hostile to them.  There are other places to learn those things...and people will go there, causing them to leave Wisconsin.
It's a stupid question. There will still be jobs. Our country will not collapse because we open up trade with other countries. Our country actually benefits from trade, and not just rich people and large corporations. We get deflation, new opportunities to export, and we can insource our labor. Trade is a net win for all economies involved. We get to produce more of what's demanded of our labor and less of what isn't.    Yes, it sucks for some people in the U.S. The solution to or countries problems is not protectionism. It just allows it to continue longer and makes it harder to solve.    Low skill labor jobs are going out the door, and trade isn't what's going to kill it for good. Technology will be the nail in the coffin. Do we ban robotics and automation? Prevent companies from using it? Stop software development? No, because it brings some huge gains to society. Trade is a lesser version of that. Instead of removing labor all together, it just switches it to countries where it's more efficient. 
If only he wasn't pretty crazy on a lot of other issues. Or the GOP primary system would reward him for this.
The fact that he is the only candidate standing up to this is evidence that he is the only candidate not able to be blackmailed. That alone is enough for me to vote for him, regardless of his politics. 
You realize I've given you a reason why the man is a loon right? you're not telling me why he isn't.  Once again, prove me wrong. Tell me why he isn't a loon.
Plenty of native folks prefer American Indian to Native American.
Sounds like you don't have the slightest clue what being a minority (especially LGBT) and living in the South (like myself) is like at all.      High School alone I had a brick thrown through my parents car window, my car was egged twice, received death threats in the mail and on my parents home phone, spit on, almost ran over in a store parking lot, had rednecks in a pick up with bats and 2x4s yelling "die faggot" chase me from my bus stop.      Be glad you can be yourself without fear of being murdered if you walk funny, talk funny or hold someone's hand in public who is of the same gender. Be glad you don't feel like you HAVE to carry as baseball bat in your car (or a gun) for fear that someone might follow you to your car one night and jump you because you "look gay".      Get some understanding of the situation before making asinine statements.
That is true also. Yet, considering the masses are generally single issue voters I think he will gain overwhelming support for this and wouldn't one think that the GOP would rather have him rather than Hillary?
Well your also being a little too doom and gloom.  It is less than the proposed $300M which would have been a [6.25% cut over two years](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2015/feb/17/scott-walkers-university-budget-cuts-13-25-16-mayb/) and tuition is frozen for only two years.    So yes, as either a tax payer or student, you would be saving money.

What is he crazy on?
&gt;In each of the last two election cycles, 14 of the top 20 donors gave their money to conservative organizations and Republican campaigns, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. **That does not include most donations to the conservative network overseen by the Kochs**, composed largely of nonprofit groups that do not reveal their donors. The network is planning to raise **$889 million** for its political and philanthropic efforts through 2016.
You don't need to do any research. All you need to do is ask yourself when, in the last two decades, the federal government has done *anything* that was for the betterment of the country as a whole- especially if it involved money or the constitution.  Edit: I'm referring to *new* programs and and the overall legislative direction.
So you're willing to admit that in the overwhelmingly majority of the time the vote for cloture is the important one?  Back when Reagan was President, Democrats controlled the Senate. They managed to engineer a number of votes that fell exactly on the 50/50 split in Congress, which compelled Vice President George H. W. Bush to go on the record voting one way or another. One if the votes was on abortion. The rest were other important policy matters. I'm not sure they had to vote for cloture at the time, but it could be a general exception to the normal order of business.
The GOP didn't put him under oath. It was a civil suit.

Don't bother.  In /r/politics, "crazy" just means "holds positions with which I disagree".
Yes they did steal your money. Rich trillionaires control all the money you use and they print it at will.  The bailouts were a net gain to me! HAHAHAHA! You are a tool dude. WAKE THE FUCK UP. It was not to my benefit to continue and save the total charade that was the US economy. It's going to crash again soon.  We have troops in both places you just mentioned and we created ISIS. They are running around in Toyota trucks using US military equipment. How old are you? Are you falling for this stuff for the first time?  This is standard procedure. They create the enemy, then WE fight them. You've read 1984 right? Brave New World? The authors weren't writing fiction. They were writing the plan. Huxley was a huge insider.  This is a good starter for someone that believes everything the gunvernment tells them: [9/11 in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLXyB5GtfBU)
If you have a mortgage you are. And if you're house is paid off you're probably not stupid enough to go without. There are a very small percentage of properties that are uninsured.
A net benefit to whom? What net benefit did we receive from NAFTA?
&gt;With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have realize what that implies. It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses.  Potential Gold standard. Audit the fed. Flat tax. Balanced budget amendment. (Really, anything related to fiscal policy).  0 Foreign aid.  Fumbling about vaccines and autism, I'm still confused about what he meant.
&gt; A cover-up is an attempt, whether successful or not, to conceal evidence of wrongdoing, error, incompetence or other embarrassing information. In a passive cover-up, information is simply not provided; in an active cover-up, deception is used.  Yes, no need to argue about - if someone abuses a process of finding evidence of wrong-doing to conceal it, it is a cover-up.
I am pretty sure that most experts would think that even considering the Gold standard is dangerous and shows a complete lack of sophistication bordering on crazy in monetary policy. A flat tax rate, are you kidding? Perhaps you would also like to respond to his fumbling of the situation where he linked vaccines with autism? Linking universal healthcare to slavery? Tell me how he isn't crazy.
It's not a trade deal, it's a corporate entitlement deal masquerading as a trade deal.

Right now is when a billionaire can have the most impact.  Fund your man now and no matter the lack of credentials and other qualifications the money for ads and organization and the like make them an instant contender
Regardless, how would the government decide who gets money? What if Joe Shmoe wants to run for president, will they give him the same amount of money as Hilary Clinton?
[deleted]
We need him in office, just not the presidential office.  He's fine where he is :)
Insurance is never about previous behavior (though it's most often calculated via such); it's protection against *future* error.   So, logically, someone who's forced to carry insurance for some reason, but who never winds up engaging that insurance, should be guaranteed a large refund at the end of their need. 
&gt; They did rule: they ruled such restrictions on speech were unconstitutional   Like I said, the ruled on that but went far beyond the scope to the case.  &gt;No they didn't: corporations still can't engage in electioneering   If they are paying for it, they are engaging in it.  &gt;Well: I get your point: but don't understand why? Why should planned parenthood not be allowed to make an ad...  They should. They are an organization chartered to do political advocacy and people giving them money know that.   &gt;When were these rules established   Right from the very beginning of our country's history. The founders had great concerns about corporate powers. The revolution was not only fought to end British rule but also to free themselves from English corporations that extracted their wealth and dominated trade.  Most of the states set up rules that specifically said corporations could not make any political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making. Nor could corporations engage in any activities not specifically necessary to fulfill their chartered purpose. And of course, the federal government gave them no special status either.  It wasn't until 1886 when a court clear clerk erroneously added the term "natural person" to the headnote to the case, it was not part of the actual ruling, that the concept of corporate personhood came into being and they started gaining 14th amendment protections. Until then, the courts had routinely held that corporations were artificial entities without the rights of people. 
He trashed the "populist president" label the second he was elected. There's a reason we're actually seeing a real populist movement now with politicians like Elizabeth Warren snd Bernie Sanders.      I think now he's using the label, "Well, at least he wasn't as bad as Bush II".
About time to kill a few churches...
Do you want to contribute or play the victim?
now that's a nice statistic. Would be interesting to compare with  how many were killed by direct physical murder, (subcatagories could include guns, knives, other objects...) abortions, lung, skin and other cancers, car accidents, accidental poisonings, medical misdiagnoses / malpractice 
Hey, if you want to tell a woman who's facing an angry group of men that pepper spray is going to protect her, be my guest, but I just bet that trying to hit four guys in the eyes with a can of mace and hoping that none of them break your arm and slug you in the jaw is a terrible feeling.  If they're going to jump a lady, I have no problem with them getting shot in the process.
He probably needed to qualify his statement somewhat. Foreign trade agreements are designed to be beneficial to American corporations, not American workers. Politicians sell these agreements to the workers by claiming they're beneficial to the US workforce.
I guess youre not if you have $300,000 cash lying around. 
Your argument is a good point against gun control generally, but requiring insurance?  Is the car analogy really flawed?  Because having a car has been essential to my survival but I have to have insurance for that.
Just so long as you acknowledge that people have been opposing it so far with uninformed criticism...

The fact is that Bernie Sanders is a crackpot and his ideas are lunatic fringe. I told my wife about the guy who wants a 90% top tax rate (applicable only to the "rich") and she even said that anyone who votes for this guy has to be some sort of idiot. 
Bush is poised to claim a feat no other President has ever claimed - to be the third in a family to accede to Presidency.    Wasn't the entire "Boston Tea Party" based on a resolve from those who chose to call themselves Americans, not to be beholden to family legacies when it came time to choose their rulers.  On point - the congress was very red when the spending bill passed and one can not imagine GWB was discouraging voting in its favour.
Most of education is migrating online. Tying skills acquisition to a specific geographic location does not make sense when everybody has a good Internet connection.  I agree that research is another matter.
Have an issue? Lets copy past Bernie's positions about it! Have a social issue? What does Bernie think?  It's just a temporary thing on reddit right now, I get it. /u/JimmyFrog didn't ask about Sanders positions on this, /u/maglevnarwhal just dumped it in there. So that to me qualifies as spam. 
Newt was in the middle of divorcing his third wife while she was in the hospital fighting cancer so he could marry his mistress.
&gt;"The newspaper scoured public documents, local news reports and witness accounts to document acts of heroism, scenes marked by chaos, and — **in less than 1% of the cases — criminal charges against the cops involved**.  ...meaning that **less than 4 of these deaths** were actually wrongful deaths.  Move along people...this isn't really newsworthy.
Look at my response to Juronell the government and free market already provide free internet access.  Its not the governments role to invest other peoples money in other people, also an investment means you'll get a return.  If you propose that the government loan people money for which to pay for internet access and then when they get a job repay the taxpayers the principle and interest (it can be a low/below market rate) that would be fine.  If this is important to you then then I'm sure there are also charities that provide computers or help with internet access that you can donate to directly.    Edit: mentioned wrong redditor in the first sentance. 
Yeah, let's elect someone that has bat shit crazy economic policy that would destroy the country because he's against the patriot act.  Great idea friend.  I support him in killing the patriot act, I would never support him as president.
I'm not talking about Michigan's legal system in this case but that Canada's bend towards harsher justice has not been particularly unreasonable. 
That's not correct, he was not convicted by the body that the constitution allows to convict him. So by the standard set by the  constitution he is decidedly not guilty of perjury.
I know many organizations that immediately throw out resumes from anyone using online universities.   The quality of employees from online schools is terrible. Its hard to believe this bubble of new online schools will last long without serious changes. 
'Rein in' like a horse?
I wouldn't say it's shills or anything, but some people are really happy that there's a candidate they finally agree with.
Thats pretty impressive considering school is out of session.  Thats 20,000 less in that town right now that would be right in his wheelhouse.  Go Hawks!
I can call a bull a cow, but it still has horns
I think you're missing the point. A very small percentage of people can buy property without acquiring a mortgage. When you acquire a mortgage you have to pay homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance will charge you extra for pets and a pool.  I don't think the gun insurance should be mandated by law. I'm all for common sense treatment of gun laws but it's too divisive an issue and the other side cares too deeply about it so I don't want democrats touching it with a ten foot pole.  There is something to be said for some kind of liability insurance for gun owners though. Who covers the cost of a wrongful death lawsuit of you have no assets to seize? If you own a house without a mortgage than you have the collateral to pay liability claims. If you don't outright  own a home and have a mortgage then you pay insurance to cover this liability. If you rent then your landlord pays this. 
I think you are confused. The other guy talking about affirmative cloture has it right. 
General question: Being forced to perform services against your will...what is that?   He was over dramatic, I agree...but not wrong.  
I've come to think that it's part of Obama's strategy.   If the GOP opposes everything he supports. Start supporting traditionally conservative positions to force them to vote against things they normally vote for.  Example; congressional authorization for invading Syria and the current military action against Daesch. 
I don't believe number 6. Just because foreign entities must now be permitted to bid on government contracts doesn't mean they have to be awarded them, or, at least, no evidence has been brought forward that I have seen that shows this to be the case.  Number 9 is also a market problem. The only reason it is an issue is because most consumer would pay the lower cost for goods without regard to where or how they're made. Rather than using government to try and solve the issue by making the products unavailable, better educate people on the cause of the price difference and what it means for workers at home and abroad.

&gt; How about putting it this way: You may not have the right to be heard, but some people have an unusually effective ability to force their speech to be heard, such that it causes a negative effect that must be legislated against to correct.  Elaborate: here I completely disagree. How is and who is forcing their speech to be heard?  &gt;What would be effects of such an action? &gt; &gt; Well, lets look at what Citizen's United does:Citizen's United basically says that the First Amendment prohibits the government from preventing corporations to make independent expenditures for political campaigning.   No, citizens united says that the government cannot restrict third party advocacy groups and their freedom and ability to exercise and promote their speech. Even during times of elections.  &gt; So if Comcast wants to run an add extolling the virtues of Candidate A (who is long been a friend of the telecommunications industry and is married to the sister of the CEO of Comcast) and they want to spent 10 billion dollars to do so, they can.   They'd have to do that through a PAC. But yes they can.  &gt; Likewise, if British Patroleum wants to run an add in every single district in the Gulf of Mexico that is negative about every single Candidate that has been critical of the BP oil spill, they are free to do so and spend as much money as they want.   They can: through PACS   &gt; Really then, the issue comes down to preventing basically unlimited spending on third party political campaigning. Citizens United allows companies to easily flood the airwaves with messages that they want people to hear,   First your last sentence: that is not the job of government. Government does not get to decide what people want to hear or not. Secondly if someone doesn't want to see an ad they just change the channel. Simple as that. Also, don't participate in the medium the ad is being presented.   Just because you don't wana see an ad for Hillary doesn't mean msnbc doesn't have the right to run Hillary ads all day.   If you don't wana see them: stop watching. No one is forcing you to watch msnbc.   &gt; and it allows them to drown out opposition, especially in smaller races, where a state candidate would not be able to compete with the bankroll of a fortune 500 company   False narrative with hundreds on hundreds of media outlets: it's almost impossible to buy up all media   &gt; There's also concerns that Citizen's United makes it harder to prevent foreign money from influencing elections by making it easier to hide the sources.   The case you are thinking of is SpeechNow  &gt; Finally, we have to be worried about the corrupting effect that it has on these politicians. Despite not donating directly to their campaigns, these politicians know where the money for the ads that got them elected comes from and it places a huge burden on them to cater to those special interests that got them elected.  Don't vote for them   
Again. He was over dramatic. But good deflection from my question.   
Okay? Even if you have 100 shell companies, you'd only be able to donate the equivalent of 101 people. And we could make legislation against that. 
The article was clear that Gingrich came out clean about it.  No perjury or obstruction there.
A PAC is supposed to be where all the Free $peech can be spent and is not "coordinated" by the candidate (Jeb's excepted).  I went to the Cal Dem Convention a little while ago and the PDA PAC had a whole bunch of Bernie literature they were giving out. So?
Sure. TL;DR This isn't something you should be lazy about. 
This is getting hilarious. 
He was fined in Arkansas for malpractice (contempt, I think) and was suspended from practicing law.  edit: yup http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/contempt041399.htm http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10904831/ns/politics/t/bill-clinton-can-re-apply-his-lawyer-license/#.VWsqo89Viko
Wasn't this land protected via treaty? You can't just pass some law that overrides a treaty, that's not how treaties work. Expect these miners to be killed in the process of attempting to mine these resources, and rightly so. 
So, you're defunding the NSA then right? So you can roll those duties into a department that hasn't been ignoring federal laws for decades?   What? You're not doing the only thing that would stop ongoing NSA overreach? What a shock.
When we elect Bernie, these empires will pay taxes to us, not the other way around.
I ain't paying that tax. 
As compared to the $52bn received by Oil companies  As compared to the $200bn received by Telcos 
Christianity was invented by politicians, it's nothing new.  The free flow of info is what's killing religion.
I love you for that and it fits to damn true.
Hate on the Patriots all you want but you have to admire one thing. Their owner, Robert Kraft, built Gillette Stadium with his own money. The stadium, shopping, office complex is a money maker. Yes, the town/state did make some highway improvements.

The issue was that Clinton lied under oath, not that he was having an affair/affairs/getting bjs.
It's called a "common fund." A powerful collective. Laws have taken over unions as the only legitimate way workers win. FLSA, fair labor standards act; OSHA, Occupation safety act; workers compensation;  LHWCA; EEOICPA; FECA; BLBA; ERISA; LMRDA; CPCA; FMLA; Davis bacon act; Walsh healey; McNamara o-hara; mine safety;  Copeland act; Lhwca; WARN; NLRB; EEOC... Unions  are not needed and no longer relevant.  Workers make more suing than asking a union boss for favors.
Well Congress is responsible for appropriations, so he is correct.
The sooner Warren endorses Sanders, the better.

Reddit's got such a sense of humor. Upvoting a commie haha you guys kill me
Maybe he should have the whole thing leaked? Isnt this whole thing almost past the point of no return? (without a revolution)
but if we treat them like people how will they be properly punished for being poor?   /s
Yup. Now how much of that was for the stadium and how much was for the highway improvements? 
I'm ok with that.
I think "dickless" refers to cowardice in this context, not literally lacking a penis. 
This is something that's always bothered me. I'm agnostic , but my family's reverand was also a teacher and has a masters in chemistry to go with the one in theology. He also had a gay twin brother. Our experience with religion has been one that embraces both science and the LGBTQ community, and it's sad to me that this is such a foreign experience for most churchgoers.
No i was just saying, anything around 1,100 people (let's say give or take 400 just to be safe) isn't thousands.  But yeah it's all just wording.
This says more about how low the Republican Party has shrunk than it does about Fox News.
How old are you? I don't think you know how the media works. Back in 2012 Ron Paul literally murdered his contenders in all the GOP debates, but was swiftly brushed aside by the media and ostracized by voters. Clinton already won.
&gt; It feels intuitively unfair to most people, myself included, to simply give an apartment to somebody without consideration of who deserves it.   How so?  We aren't talking about palatial residences here.  We are talking about small apartments.  I don't see anything inherently unfair about it.
Irrelevant. One would not exist without the other.
Please, Clinton wasn't impeached for what they did...he was impeached for what HE did.  And yes, our presidents should be held to a higher standard.  If they don't agree with this, then don't run for public office.
I'm pretty sure I can complain about both.
If you remember, Unions were one of the major backers of Obamacare, but then lobbied to be exempt from it.  http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-exemptions-unions-republicans/2013/11/20/id/537720/
I don't under estimate how his message plays on reddit. Its tailor made for reddit. If it was any better I would suspect a long term scheme.  He's pandering to a group of very like minded individuals, in fact it probably isn't pandering at all. His politics are decent and he seems like a good dude, albeit a bit of an ideologue.   He's got to propagate his memes like everyone else though. Frankly I just don't think there is enough overnight traffic in the r/politics new queue for these type of posts to happen organically. I don't know how this works exactly but I have ideas. If you wake up early Sunday morning, 8am EST and check the new queue you can see all the submissions from the previous night. Most of these submissions are going to have between  a few and and a few dozen upvotes and comments. Your also going to see a one or two posts with hundreds of upvotes and few comments. And these things are sketchy because often enough there will be very similar content within the more common vote and comment range. So you can see what is happening, someone is boosting certain posts.    And this is actually a really great idea, because its probably very cheap compared to traditional advertising and because this platform is a but of a progressive echo chamber and the users are going to repropagate the Gospel according to Bernie on other social media platforms.   I would actually like to understand how this works exactly because I think I could do it myself. If you have any ideas let me know. 
You are promoting restricting action, not me. I'm promoting choice. Employees have a choice where to work, employers have a choice of benefits to offer.
Ron Paul is a bigoted clown.  Doesn't relate to Bernie Sanders whatsoever.  Sorry..  Oh, and that "How old are you?" intro is tired and weak.  Try something else, maybe?
Well, technically, it is still the Theory of Evolution.
Ron Paul is a pathetic bigot.  I don't see why people keep comparing that half-wit to Bernie.    Dumb comparison.
And what I am saying is that as a third party individual with no affiliation to the sanders campaign I have been actively promoting Sanders on reddit.   That's the buy in I think you are missing, people are supporting him, submitting and up-voting his stuff organically. Precisely because we believe he is not pandering.   I don't think this is a case of astroturfing, I think it's just a case of a lot of people agreeing with him, being frustrated with the mainstream coverage of the candidate, and doing what they can to increase his visibility. 
I don't need to call bullshit, I only need to correct you.  &gt; The Administration estimates that the tax changes outlined in the budget proposal would provide $22.133 billion in revenues over the period FY2013 to FY2017, and $38.56 billion from FY2013 to FY2022.  Estimates over a period of time, they have not received all of them yet unlike your generic claim:   &gt; As compared to the $52bn received by Oil companies

They are in the news because it has become THE news item recently.    Just because they talk about it, doesn't mean that it is actually an issue.

   Republican Senator Bob Corker said it well:  &gt;“It’s obvious to me that the Audit the Fed effort is to not to address auditing the Fed because the Fed is audited,” Corker said. “So to me it’s an attempt to allow Congress to be able to put pressure on Fed members relative to monetary policy. And I would just advocate that would not be a particularly good idea and it would cause us to put off tough decisions for the future, like we currently are doing with budgetary matters. Do you agree with that?”
What I'm saying is that it is obvious that his posts are being boosted, because of of a unnatural amount of votes and comments and that this is not something that is happening because a group of people on reddit are all in with Sanders.   You can check this yourself. Next Sunday check the new queue of politics  and there are going to be about half a dozen submissions with Bernie Sanders in the title. One of those submissions will have hundreds of votes the rest will have dozens of votes. They will all have the same number of comments, between 5 and 15. 
How is this case in point? OP was talking about her backers. Where she gets most of her campaign money. 
Not entirely. The civil war was about slavery, the state's rights issue was mostly just the presumption. Post civil war, state's rights were still strong (Jim Crow laws for example) and it wasn't until the big Federalism movements that this stopped being the case completely.
And funded the democrats.

Losing a court case is not the best way to win a court case.  Last time I checked, losing a court case was a losing strategy.

This is absolutely the best explanation.  I'm a liberal, but I actually think liberals are sometimes more attached to the 'just world order' and the idea that people who are not successful should be punished and suffer for not engaging in the pursuit/worship of wealth or status in the way that they did.   You have failed morally and spiritually on the deepest level if you, at some point, decided that you didn't want to sacrifice your life to the pursuit of status and money.  It's amazing how many 'liberals' are willing to participate in the exact same type of hatred and scorn of the poor and disenfranchised that the people on the right who they hate so much do.

Nah actually none of what you're saying is even close to true.  But thanks for trying.
I was being sarcastic......
Bernie Sanders wants to give everyone free everything. The only way to do that is to have the power to take everything away from everyone.
Don't buy that line OP. Our volunteer army fights for oil, Israel and expected future benefits.
Unions are pretty awesome and protect employees.  If anyone disputes this look at police unions.  NYT just had an article about police unions and how they protect police too much.  I tried to start a union at my place of work because we were abused profusely and was wrongfully terminated.  NLRB is the best place to start if you would like to or are thinking of starting a union.
Bahahahahaha!!
Yup. 
No, it was legal for the bank to report it as suspicious.  It was illegal to pay 3.5 mil to cover up child rape.
Wrong, freedom doesn't create hate, repression and violence creates hate.
  Republicans get Boehners when they kill poor and black people.  Chances are a couple will be innocent, but no matter. They are not me and they should die.
&gt; just endless bad press.  I generally support unions, but if unions want to avoid bad press, they need to stop doing stupid things like endlessly supporting workers who've committed obviously harmful/illegal/outrageous acts for which they deserve to be fired.
Ha, "obviously" 
If that is the case it's only because the GOP doesn't give a shit about the working man.
so I know what LGBT is, but what does the Q stand for? I'm scared to google it. 
Most of what Sanders wants is pretty sane.  You're trying to compare someone that wants to fix the education system and give us a single payer healthcare system to someone that wants to slash taxes and cut funding to the government.  We have evidence the things sanders wants will work, we have evidence flat out slashing taxes is a horrible idea.  Which one is more sane to you.
Is it fair to say we should have seen it coming?
The decrease in purchasing power is the direct result of government and federal reserve policy, not the market. The market economy offshoring to produce cheaper goods and services actually helps raise the purchasing power for the people who most need it, the poor and middle class, and gives jobs in poor countries to people who desperately need them. It's a win/win, and Bernie Sanders and most of his supporters want to end this, which would hurt poor people here AND poor people in those 3rd world countries. Bernie is on record saying that slower growth and higher prices would be a good thing, which is just fucking batshit crazy, he obviously has no idea what it's like to be poor and not be able to afford higher prices. The fact that people choose to buy cheaper goods and work in those manufacturing plants proves they improve their standard of living...or they wouldn't make those choices...  Bernie should find ways to decrease the cost of living here, rather than increasing it and then shittalking every firm that does try to decrease the cost of living for poor people, like Walmart and Target. Without these firms doing everything they can to keep prices as low as possible we'd all be far worse off because of the government and the federal reserve. It's easy to see the real problem is the government and the fed, but Bernie can't see it, he's a clueless populist who needs to read a book on economics.
&gt; get your facts correct.  It's like the abortion issue in that the facts driving the most heated opinions are equally true (guns are lethal vs. there is a 2nd amendment). But people can't keep saying the same thing, so both sides drift into fantasy to support what they already know to be true.
Here's the deal, as I see it:  It would be wrong for a pastor to deny the rights of a gay couple to have a traditional christian wedding. It would also be wrong to force a pastor to conduct such a ceremony against his/her religious beliefs. In either case civil liberties are being denied.   Using legislation to force progress on either of these issues is only going to cause them to become more divisive. This issue only gets solved when religion becomes a non-issue through a more educated, forward thinking populace, in which society has evolved to the point where being religious is analogous to not being religious in the 12th century A.D.   We're not there yet, but we're going that way slowly but surely. 
&gt; The good is that it removes National Security Letters (which have no judicial oversight and give the FBI the ability to collect similar information) and pen registers -- which are things that are not expiring we nothing happens tomorrow.  My understanding is that these are both Section 215 items that expire.
That's probably due to the atheist/libertarian correlation.
The problem with any state-regulated drug is that it will inevitably flood the market of states that want to keep it illegal. Just like pollution from fracking, there's diffusion of the drug throughout the market.

No, you are jumping to conclusions without firm evidence. If exit polls deviate it could mean several things, I have put them in order of most likely to least likely.  * District had many absentee or mail in votes  * Bad sample, one side voters were more likely to answer pollster  * Vote miscount by election officials  * electoral fraud by election officials  * Hacking of voting machines  * Voter fraud
 They are in line for the wealthy. But police act against unions and union organizers. Cops are still useful. When unions are gone police and fire unions will go under attack too.

Unions ARE the mob, yes?  http://teamster.org/
Or so corporations would like you to believe.
To only target one party in your assessment shows that you fail to understand that this is a problem that affects every group or party in politics. To blame one party over the other shows that you are a follower of the system and they have succeeded in making you think one party is better than the other when both parties work this way. It's sad. Your part of the problem. 
It would have these problems regardless; this just speeds up its demise.

Queer is really just more of an all encompassing term. I know some people make the acronym even longer but it's really a catch all.
You can chart the decline of this nations middle class all the way to its start...the election of Reagan. 
Well, he has to come up with some explanation why GDP growth is nearly double under Democratic presidents.  Otherwise the "fiscal conservative" myth loses a lot of its power.  The fact that he can't even blame Democrats for this is especially telling.
Well, the people I knew of who unions defended were caught watching porn on computers and/or disrupting work crews in other ways time after time. It amounted to few actual cases, but as I said, it gives unions a bad image that their enemies love to exploit.

&gt;Also, can you provide any link to someone blaming any weather event on global cooling?  For an unusually evenhanded overview [go here.](http://www.climatecooling.org/)  I did like one section titled "What Does the Consensus Say About the Skeptics?" where you hit two of the three points. 1) On Somebody's Payroll and 2) Not Mainstream Scientists. You missed 3) Disproportionate Press Coverage.  The bottom line is that there is a lot of 'science' being bought and sold and those with the money are getting what they are paying for—on all sides of the issue. You don't trust industry money and I don't trust government money. The government has a vested interest in outcomes that give it more power and with it the ability to license, regulate and tax—individual liberties, rights and freedoms be damned.   Maybe you weren't around but in 1976, climatologists said that that global cooling caused drought and fires in California, and produced catastrophic erratic weather globally. To put the 1970's Global Cooling consensus in context [try this](http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/02/the-1970s-global-cooling-alarmism.html)  But that was before computer modeling, based on incomplete, questionable, and easily manipulated data, took the place of reality.
No one said unions were perfect.
While I totally agree with your general distaste for overbearing atheists,  &gt; Your devotion to the absence of the supernatural is just as blind and unsupported as devotion to the supernatural.  That is a false equivalency.  Yes, neither side has proof of where they stand. But one side is arguing that we should assume that the rest of the universe behaves according to constant rules we have observed about reality. The other is making a guess as to what else could be possible, divorced from evidence.

To be fair, doesn't it? At least to the extent that religions claim to be able to explain the way the world works. "Ra raises the sun" and all that.
You're a defeatist and already hopelessly tied to war.

So, unionization provides more benefits than just wages. Unions typically improve working conditions and terms of employment beyond just wages.   If they employees want the ability to use wage reductions as a bargaining chip to obtain concessions on the structure of their work or maybe even to gain access to *benefits*, it might make sense for them to do it. Workplace dignity might be more valuable than a few dollars an hour.   Keep in mind what might be on the table at collective bargaining: scheduling, hours, the structure of certain specific duties, safety measures, staffing levels, bonus structures, benefits, sick days, holidays, leaves, discipline. That's just a start. The membership might rationally prefer improvements on any of these fronts instead of the full $15/hour wage. 
[deleted]
This  article is incredibly misleading. The unions are asking to allow workers, collectively, to chose to be below $15 hourly wage so that they may negotiate other benefits which the workers may wish.   The $15 hour limit is necessary for workers who ARE NOT represented by unions and therefore are not granted protection. All this article is meant to be is porn for those who have an already existing, and usually irrational, predisposition to unions. Read people, don't be sheeped into supported oligarchy. 
Good?!?!
Well, really, the Bible just sort of explains *why* things exist. Science explains how they exist. So, they can both be believed without any needing to jump through mental hoops to justify things.
According to the stats, for roughly 20%, the suspect was unarmed. It's very difficult to justify deadly force in those cases. For the other 80%, some percentage were armed, but attempting to flee. Others were armed, but mentally handicapped and only threatening themselves. Another group was "armed", but include situations like the guy in Smyrna, GA. He was attempting to flee in a vehicle, so technically "armed", but the accusations are that the police put themselves in harm's way artificially to justify deadly force (by jumping in front of the car). The stats are "fuzzy", but the actual justified killings could be closer to only 50% rather than 99%. Whether they filed for wrongful death may have more to do with how poor they are, or other more social aspects. 
[deleted]
Sarcasm right?
A government sanctioned monopoly on the ability to provide workers for under the minimum wage.  A lone person is apparently unable to decide for themselves how much they would like to work for, but a group of people paying union dues that go to support a certain political party are capable of doing so in the world of a brain dead leftist.  Democrats are so full of shit it's hilarious.  Union parasites need to rot in hell.
There's an argument to be made certainly.  Here's the thing though, we all agree that having clean water falls within the general Welfare clause...but when it comes to naturally occurring gases, that absolutely stretches the meaning of "general welfare".  When the authority is stretched to apply to migratory birds, it also stretches the meaning of "general welfare", as does regulating farm watering holes.  So when you're talking about regulating waterways like rivers...absolutely they can.  When it comes to these other things, they've stretched their authority into the arena where general welfare no longer applies.   Edit:  That authority you cited also applies to the taxing and spending clause, so it also only applies to the Government's ability to tax/spend for the General Welfare.

Unions today are doing a good job at making people hate them.  The teachers union in my state seems to strike every couple of years.
&gt;"He's one senator, who's in a small minority on this issue. There's only so much he can do."  I agree, but there's this idiotic theme going around that old Rand is "the only one championing our freedumbs" when the truth is that the NSA was doing illegal shit before the Patriot Act, they're doing illegal shit now, and if Rand succeeds in his efforts they'll CONTINUE to do illegal shit regardless.  Defunding them is the only way to stop their bullshit. They haven't ONCE needed Congress's permission to do a single damn thing and they aren't going to suddenly stop because Congress feels like it.
What is?
US politics sounds like the Tour d'France in the Armstrong era seems like everyone at the top is dirty, lying, cheating. 
If we accept this argument, that because something is reported a politician is responsible for it happening, then it means that we must accept that Hillary could have prevented Benghazi but chose not to.  In reality everything is being reported, all the time.  Its not a clean world out there -- its full of vague intentions and empty bluster.  Sorting out the truth from this soup is not something we should expect with 100% accuracy.  And remember, nobody hears about it when the authorities are right and problems are defused.  They only hear about it when there's a mistake.  An interesting corollary to all this is that if we accept that it is the government's mandate to prevent attacks before they happen without fail, then we must also accept that the Patriot Act in all its data-gobbling glory is completely necessary.  While we might not have used that data to its fullest in the past, that is no reason to suppose we cannot use it more effectively in the future.  The first step in preventing attacks is having information on those attacks.  So, naturally, the Patriot Act follows.
Haha yeah I think that's probably a good idea. 
Sanders has a good voting record on this stuff. Personally I plan to donate equal amounts to both, register independent, and vote for whichever is doing better by the time the primaries get to my state.
It was a derogatory slang. But the community has reappropriated it.
  They still have to defend them. The unions are happy to see people like that lose their jobs. They make it harder on everybody who takes their jobs seriously. But unions still have to defend them. they have no choice.
Which they had, making the veto a non-issue, irrelevant.
I'd probably go further back than that.  It's been going for as long as there were organized labor groups, socialists, and communists in the U.S.  By the time Reagan got elected, "socialism" &amp; "communism" were already dirty words.
Right.  About 10 a year.  Fire them, convict them, and pay the civil suits.  10 out of millions of encounters is not a bad ratio.  I am sorry for the families for their loss, but seriously, this is really not a big deal.

&gt;Weather you think Socialism is bad or good or right or wrong is one thing but to openly deny something that is blatantly obvious is hilarious.   I'm a socialist. I think socialism is a good thing. Just look at my post history.  &gt;Wake the fuck up dude, Bernie Sanders is very, VERY, socialist.  Show me one instance where Bernie Sanders says something like "the means of production should be democratically owned by the proletariat." Bernie Sanders is a **social democrat**  who erroneously labels himself as a socialist.
Bush is responsible for leading us into two wars "paid for" with tax cuts on the wealthy.     
How much of the strength of unions was influenced by the mob ties though? Or were the mob only involved in a few unions? I can't help but wonder if the unions were weakened as much by corporate greed as by losing their mob support due to law enforcement pressure.
The usage of Queer is derived from use in engineering meaning 'not as expected/intended'  As in, you make a corner and find that it is not a 90 degree corner, it might be described as a 'queer corner'  At this point, queer is often used as a catchall by anyone that doesn't identify as cis-gender heteronormative
It's not good. Ron Paul was the best candidate in every election he was in and yet because the media didn't talk about him, people that would have agreed with him never got the chance to learn about his positions. People should do more independent research rather than rely solely on TV but that's beside the point. 
I don't foresee unions ever coming back to the state they were in years ago.
I predict you will be misinterpreted.
It doesn't have to.  You can believe that everything that we've learned through science is how Ra or another higher power makes the world happen.  If there were a creator, its possible that the laws of physics, evolution, and the whole universe are just the great mechanisms through which the design is realized.   Only if you take religious teaching as purely literal explanations instead of another path to understanding does it contradict science.  That difference changed me from being an athiest to a much happier and accepting agnostic.  You can have faith and still be logical and scientific without completely abandoning the possibility of something that is beyond our observable universe.    
I don't really buy that.  Why do they have no choice but to accept willful incompetence and flagrant rule violations?  
Obviously he meant making sure the minimum wage is as low as possible. You gotta keep the least of these brothers and sisters as "Least" as possible after all.

You forgot another A for Aromantic as well, which are really just people down for sex but not relationships.

&gt;what? Christianity was invented by the underclass of society in secret for fear of being killed.  Paul was hardly the underlcass of society. He was pretty well educated and probably "rich" by the standards of the day. 
Why didn't you quit your job if it was so terrible?   Have you started your own company and hired some employees of your own since then?
But being smug is so much fun
Ok, but a minimum wage of some sort for unionized workplaces *combined with* a higher minimum for competing non-union environments creates a different set of bargaining conditions than "no minimum wage", now doesn't it? 
I said it before and I'll say it again. In the last 100 years, the worst possible thing to happen to the United States of America is for the Republicans to control the Presidency, House of Representatives and Senate all at the same time.   The Republicans achieved this clusterfuck trifecta of doom twice in the last 100 years.   The first was from 1921-1933 where they caused the Republican Great Depression.   The second was from 2001-2007 where they would go on to cause The Great Bush Crash, the largest economic crisis since the Republican Great Depression.   So yeah, Jeb is right to blame the GOP Congress. But his brother is to blame as well. 
Some unions ARE too powerful though. Some of the larges special interests in Washington are unions.  I support unions when they are a free market entity, rallying for workers when conditions are unanimously regarded as poor.  I hate when unions become overly controlling though. The idea that a union can compel membership is kind of disgusting. That means that even in a situation where most workers are satisfied, the Union is exerting power over the employer.
Unions only work in a context where there is a scarcity of workers. That's why they only exist in the trades and a few other outliers like telecom.
I will just ignore your straw man arguments there and reframe my statement as:  Science is not a religion. Religion is not a science.   That said I would never make the case that religion can perfectly or even adequately describe anything. Religion is a social construct, it exists for people to help them make sense of their lives.  P.S. I don't use religion this way. I am quite secure in my atheism. 
No kidding.  Well-documented mountains of youth pastors gone wrong alone probably bury the statistics.
Doesn't really matter if he beats her in a debate.  Remember when Romney took a giant dump on Obama in the first two debates?  Obama still won.
From a fellow athiest, the problem is that you sound like a jackass.   I agree, getting dressed up and going to church is silly. I'm gonna spend my Sunday doing archery and playing video games, personally.   But when you talk down to folks because of your faith you're creating a similar hostility that many of us experienced from the religious folks growing up.   I get it. I got my ass kicked as a kid because I was an athiest. I got treated badly because of my lack of faith.   The difference is that I don't see that as a justification to insult people now
We used to produce quality until we got into competing with low wage labor.
You also have millions of illegal aliens depressing wage rates for low and middle-low income/skill jobs.  You can thank big business for that turn of events.    But he is correct about unions, too.  
He's unpopular because socialism isn't popular in America outside of the college students on reddit (who won't vote anyway) and the boomer hippies.
&gt;What is ISSA made up of?  The fuck is ISSA? The Information Systems Security Association?  Edit: Did you mistake ISIS for ISSA? If so, your comprehension is worse than I thought.  &gt; I don't know if you know this, but members of a union (or ISSA) are far more likely to come together and pool resources.  Corporations are made up of shareholders. By the very definition of a corporation, they have come together and pooled resources.  &gt;Where as a corporation is largely held by an owner or owners.  Who are generally people.  &gt;  And people who work for the corporation - are they included?   Not unless they own shares in the corporation.   &gt;Do they have to be?   Only if they are forced to hold shares in the corporation.  &gt; Can the corporation force its employee to take a political action against their will?  Nope. That'd be illegal. The corporation also can't force shareholders to take political action against their will. What they can do is vote on what the group is going is going to spend its pooled money on. If you strongly disagree with the decision, you are more than welcome to sell your shares.  &gt;If so, then what is such a corporation other than an out-sourced Hatch Act violation? Eh?  Do you believe that there may be certain actions that are in the best interests of a corporation. Like, for instance, I imagine Planned Parenthood does not want abortion or birth control to be banned. Why is it not okay for such organizations to vocalize their beliefs and tell voters what they beleive should be done? 
&gt; That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.  Huh?  They should be fighting for fair conditions/wages for workers, not defending lazy slackers.  
Obama seems to think that the only way to get results is mandating everything from all the way on top, screw local government autonomy, consumer freedom etc.
If they can't pay a decent wage they should close up and let someone else take their place. Can't pay minimum-wage is too subjective. That could be 1 million reasons why poor management etc. and it's not up to the public to just take what they say at face value
Like nigger
I literally haven't heard anyone mention Bernie Sanders outside of people on /r/politics.  No one seems to give a shit about his socialist policy proposals.
Also was way less women in the workforce to drive wages down.
You really don't understand how any of this works, do you?
It's complicated. The EPA definitely has the right to regulate any source of interstate pollution, but that doesn't seem to be a factor here.  For in-state pollution, the way I understand it is that the federal government offers incentives to states to regulate pollution. If the EPA can prove that Texas isn't enforcing compliance with federal rules, it can withdraw the incentive, and may be able to force Texas to pay back past incentives.  However, it's not clear that Texas is out of compliance. I don't know if the federal regulation is on overall emissions, or if they say that a plant can never exceed a certain rate of emissions. So it's possible that the plants in question are in full compliance.
Good.

I sent you a life raft, dont know if it was enough.  Welcome to the club.  Anything u say that is not in 100% agreement will be met with downvotes and a multitude of irrational replies espousing the same talking point and a bonus comment on why you havent replied to every single reply because your logic "falls to shit."  But of course, /poltics isnt consciously partisan, it is mindlessly partisan.  For me i would align myself more closely with libertarians.  However, its not that i disagree with liberal sentiment, i just dont see federal, geographically agnostic, and costly implementations as the right way to go.  keep it simple, keep it local.  Anyways more people should read your post and consider, am i about team citizens or am i about team blue/red.  Good Post.  EDIT: and were in the same boat, see you at the bottom :P

Have to agree with this. I've worked in shops where I was told up front "we're non-union and want to keep it that way, we support our workers, *blah blah blah...*" Shit wages (well below union), shit raises, and let go as soon as things took a downturn because there was no protection or representation.

Quality of work is but one of many factors that make a good employee. Tenure length demonstrates a level of accountability and reliability, which are both important along with quality of work.  It doesn't matter if an employee can produce a high quality product in half the time as everyone else if that employee is known to hop from job to job every few months.

The Bureau of Investigation became the FBI because they had to get Federal power to hunt communists and socialists in the US after the end of WWI and the bolchevik revolution.  IMO, what changed was the oil crises and the end of easy and fast energy growth, which lead to slower economic growth, which lead wealthy people to increase inequality to keep getting wealthier without growth.  Unions were not busted by the capitalists, they were busted by unemployment: when growth is slower than immigration + productivity growth (automation), we get structural unemployment.  And when there is no job for everyone, unions cannot prevent people from lowering their standards.  European unions survived longer because they reduced weekly hours and added more paid holidays, reducing the supply of labour.

You're once again making patently false claims based upon your own liberal ideology. Organization such as civic groups, trade unions, political parties and yes, even corporations enjoy a constitutional right to free speech. It's been that way since 1789 and try all you want you can't selectively change it now to censor speech you disagree with. If you and the rest of the liberal extremists in the Democrat party don't believe that how can justify the corporation producing Michael Moore's film having a right to free speech whole denying that exact same right to Citizens United?

For their dues, the members are getting someone who has their back. Someone they go to when they're having problems at their workplace and will fix them with more power than they could have ever had on their own.   If it's really a problem and the union isn't doing their part, get involved! Go to meetings, become an elected official. Tell everyone to vote no on the low wage contract. The great thing about unions is you have the ability to actually change things if they are a widespread problem amongst employees.
We don't have a Captialistic healthcare system. The government sets the prices with Medicare. There is no competition whatsoever, as your insurance pays your bills, and your employer picks your insurance. A common solution proposed to fix healthcare is to make it MORE free market capitalistic, such that there is far more competition on treatments and procedures, driving price down.  There are loads of banking regulations and rules. Some that help and some that don't
Depending on how many workers your union represents and where you live, those numbers are not that unreasonable.

It's not just about the fatalities, but the abuse the police routinely suffer from people who are suspected of breaking the law, are so drunk/doped up that they can't be reasoned with, etc...the police see the dark underbelly of what society is.  Other professions do not.  Think about the recent Panama Beach scare.  The cops have to deal with that, even though not a single cop died while dealing with it.  It's sickening, and it's abuse, and it's not the police that are being abusive. http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/15/us/florida-panama-city-beach-spring-break/

You do know that it's harder end debate (60 vote threshold) than it is to pass the bill (51 vote threshold), right?  Voting to end cloture is effectively voting for the bill because if you can get the tough 60th vote, you can get your 51 votes.

The problem with this criticism is that it conflates two different, but related, union-backed efforts: 1) collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) and 2) minimum wages.  In theory, the outcome of a collective bargaining agreement is fair because the workers under the bargaining unit voted for it and because they bargained collectively, it represents the maximum, equitable arrangement between labor and management. Even if it provides for wages below the minimum wage, it still is fair because the members agreed to it (and in practice, what you might find is that while wages are slightly lower than the minimum wage, there are benefits that make up the difference that would not have been agreed to outside of the collective bargaining, like health care or job security provisions).  That is separate from the minimum wage fight. The fact is, most U.S. employees aren't covered under CBAs and many states and politicians at the federal level have made it incredibly difficult to organize a bargaining unit. Therefore, many unions also support fair minimum wages for workers that are not, and likely cannot be, represented under a CBA.  If you look in certain Scandinavian countries, there is no minimum wage, but almost all workers are under a CBA (or are management). Since this isn't the case in the U.S., unions and groups interested in the working class are fighting for a higher minimum wage. This benefits all those workers who can't bargain collectively. Unfortunately, unions are then subject to the hypocrisy criticism when they want exceptions to minimum wage laws in the context of CBAs. But, in truth, if the U.S. wasn't so hostile to collective bargaining, there wouldn't be a need for minimum wage laws in the first place.
Why? That's a serious question. Why should someone have to work in order to live, particularly with rapidly increasing automation?
This is very common for longshoremen in an area I used to live as well. Unions can be a good thing, but too often they can be more harmful than good

I've seen unions stick up for shitbag employees, too, though. Particularly teachers unions. You don't do your members overall any favors by vigorously defending someone who just doesn't even try to do his or her job anymore

The man votes like 98% of the time with Democrats, and is actually now a Democrat as he is running for election under that party. He also caucuses with Democrats, and his committee assignments are as a Democrat.  There is nothing Independent about Sanders, he is only a IINO (Independent in Name Only.)  
When it's 99%, don't the unions rest on their laurels knowing they don't have to do much to keep the money rolling in?
At this point my expectations are so low that I only ask two things of presidential candidates: don't turn the U.S. into an Orwellian nightmare, and don't turn the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland with global warming.  Sanders is the only one who's good on both. But if, by the time my state does primaries, the Democrats have gone ahead and coronated Clinton then I'll vote for the only other candidate who's any good on the first issue.

&gt; It is fascinating how the Religious Right has completely divorced themselves from any sort of New Testament caring for the poor type stuff.  This is a bullshit argument.  The religious right donates more to charities than any other demographic in the united states.  The difference is they want to donate to their church so they can proselytize while helping the poor.  The religious right isn't against helping the poor, they are against the government forcing them to do it.  Acting like the religious right are not very "christian" is just a way for the "liberal christians" to not feel bad for perpetuating an ideology that gets abused so easily.
Yeah, I know of them.

Unions have become nothing more than corporations that hire out their members.  They don't actually give a shit about the employee, only the amount of money they'll receive, the power they can wield.
&gt; crime of allegedly having sex with a high school male student before he took office  Why is having sex with a high school student illegal?
&gt;Unions that pushed for it that want exemptions for pumping up union rolls, i.e. labor unions could give a damn about the minimum wage as long as passing it (and being exempt from it) increases union membership. That's picture-perfect corruption.  Disagree. A lot of these union jobs come with lots of benefits that aren't quantified monetarily by the minimum wage alone. The people making minimum wage are also getting garbage/no benefits and that should factor in.  I don't agree at all with their stance, but I see the logic in it, and it's far from "corruption."
I took a few classes on the bible at a private baptist university, we were thought that the bible is divinely influenced but still written by man and has errors. The old testament was written long after the actual events and obviously is going to be as accurate as any stories kept around orally over thousands of years. In the new testament we get the story of Jesus from several perspectives and we were taught obviously they can't all be right but you can see the different writers points of view and draw a picture from those. You are drawing the picture of Christianity that you get from the media and places like /r/atheism, what you are saying is a very narrow view that is certainly not held by all Christians.
sssshhhh we don't want facts here
Don't forget us Jews! Apparently we've learned to trust science.

The cancer of Protestantism
&gt; I know guys in their 20s that hate unions. They do not know why, but for some reason, they just know they are the problem. They can not come near a reasonable defense of the position.  in 20s.. dont like unions  reason : work with people in unions  -seniority is greater than quality -they generally dont want to do anything -demand overtime when its not needed -they dont actually care about the workforce, just making sure they get paid  i can go on but this is mostly unions where i work and probably doesnt represent unions elsewhere
Then why did they push for a $15 min wage instead of trying to get places to unionize? And unless you can prove the benefits the unions are giving their employees you're just talking out of your ass.
lol how is it discrimination? The group with more bargaining power benefits from the rule LESS.
Genuine question from a young person: what exactly changed after the Patriot act?
$26,000,000/year.  $2,100,000/month.  $67,000/day.  $2800/hour.  And for the next 10 years they don't have to negotiate a single contract.  The last thing they did was send out a survey asking if the company requires you to use your personal cell phone for company business.  Seriously!?  $2800/hour for that?  Give me a break.
In a court of law what appears to be a guilty man still gets a good defence for a reason. I wont try to explain it, you "get" that concept or not in my experience.  There are clear criteria for firing in every union I have ever seen.  Your argument is really invalid.  
I have never met a happy Government union worker. Unions in the private sector are good, public unions are bad. (I am a libertarian politically, but I employ union workers. I do this because it is a good product)
I worked at an employee with a union once when I was young and that was enough for me to not do it again.  It was one of those water cooler type problems.  I would get grief for not taking my coffee break with everyone else.  The "job security" work was ridiculous.  "You can't fix that, it is someone else's job".  Infuriating.  That said, there are places where unions make sense.  Unions where you have very low skilled jobs that are easy to fill help because no one individual is valuable enough to negotiate with, but as a group they have more power.  Unions in jobs with only one possible employer are another place where it makes some sense because there is no negotiating if you have no power to leave.  Nurses in Canada are like this because the provincial health care system is the only employer (of any size) so a nurse cannot threaten to leave if he/she doesn't like the terms.  Teachers are similar.  However, unions negotiating with governments almost always ends poorly because one side has almost unlimited funds and tends to be responsible for essential services.  How can you say no to teachers or nurses asking for raises when you can just increase taxes to pay for it?  How do you measure how much each employee is worth when they are actually a cost, not a benefit?  In the private sector, when a union demands a raise, the employer can look at their books and see that they will still earn a profit if they pay up to $x, and offer that.  In the union rejects it then they close, because they know the exact dollar contribution that the average employee contributes.  For teachers and nurses paying each more costs the tax payers more money.  They provide value but there is no good way to measure it.  Do you get 20% better students if you pay teachers 20% more?  Who knows?  It is complicated.
Well, it's not my problem if I see someone drowning.  But I'd still lend a hand.  It's not my problem when I see an old woman carrying bags.  But I still help.  It's not anyone's problem if someone needs a bone marrow transplant or if someone needs a blood transfusion.  But people still donate blood and donate bone marrow and even their own organs.    All of these examples are of people could have made different choices and possibly not had the problems they ended up with that needed help.  But we still help.  Because that's what you do when you're part of a community and part of a civilization.  You build a stronger group, not just strong individuals.  Is a society without compassion really  a society you want to live in?  We're all in this together.  If we don't help one another to succeed - we all fail.
Well spoken.    In fact, even if you want to make gay marriage and abortion an election issue, the libertarians are the original pro-gay rights and abortion advocates, all the way back to the 70s.  Their position was simply that they wanted government out of those issues i.e. it's not government's business to tell you who you can marry.  To many Democrats' current distaste, even back in the 90s, when Democrats were supporting Clinton's Defense of Marriage Act, the only people who were pro-gay marriage were the Libertarians.  Add to that the current surveillance state threat many on Reddit lament on a daily basis, and it really shouldn't be that hard to make your mind up.
Obviously not from that graph. Did you notice the upswing on Sander's polling numbers since January? In that short time, he's gone from 3% to 14%. And considering he only officially announced this week, that's some pretty impressive momentum with a long way to go.  &gt;I wonder where they might have gotten that idea.  Out of their collective ass apparently.
I am actually OK with churches seeking protection from federal law regarding many issues, despite the fact I believe them to be crazy. The pendulum is swinging in the opposite direction and it is swinging too far too fast.  Two wrongs do not make a right. There should be some semblance of sovereignty when it comes to religions and their houses of worship. I am not suggesting that murder should be allowed, but we are now attempting to legislate a group's moral codes.   Right or absurd, churches of all faiths should have the ability to legally stand for their beliefs. Will that alienate a portion of the populous? Sure, but it is their choice to be troglodytes.  This is basically no different than having elder care homes with IQ proficiency standards, country clubs that require you be a part of the neighborhood, or being affiliated with a member of a credit union to join said banking establishment.  There are many restrictions throughout the world yet we aren't up in arms over those slights. However, whenever religion gets integrated into the mix, regardless of the religion, the media has a field day with the story.   The crusade to vanquish distasteful religious beliefs from the earth borders on insane and somewhat fascist.
&gt;The Freedom Act,   Congress must laugh their asses off after they name these bills.
&gt; Some unions ARE too powerful though.   Of the ten largest groups that donate money to political parties, 7 of the 10 are unions.   Service Employees International Union all by itself has more money-in-politics than Goldman Sachs, Lockheed Martin, the Koch brothers, Comcast, Pfizer, Chevron, Wal-Mart, and Exxon Mobil all eight put together. Yet people still buy into the mindset that corporations have taken over government and unions are the poor helpless scrappy underdog fighting against impossible odds.  **[Source](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php)** 
I'm not quite sure what you mean? I'm saying his interpretation of the bible is a literal-factual one only shared by the most fundamentalist of Christians or Jews.

Ultimately this is why I don't feel sorry for 20-somethings who make shit money and live paycheck to paycheck. You have enough time to browse Tinder but not educate yourself about Unions and why they came to be? Enjoy your newfound serfdom. Stay a while.   We can't just blame politicians. If we as a society are so fragile that a few greedy bastards can destroy everything out grandparents fought for, then honestly, we just don't deserve a high quality of life and free time.   Walker was *elected*. He didn't seize power in a coup. I'm just going to sit back and watch him and his cronies turn Wisconsin into a 3rd world feudal society and not feel an ounce of sympathy.

What Union do you work for?   Again, if your union is very large, is in a high cost of living area, and offers the right tools for its members to leverage, it could be justifiable.  Even a small union in the low cost of living area I live in has a hall it offers to all its members. They can use it for whatever they want free of charge; weddings, retirements, etc. That alone has a pretty decent daily operating expense. That's one thing for one small union.

I've worked in several companies too date, one was a public sector company and the other all private sector. I have never encountered a lazier work environment than the one within that public sector company and it was highly unionised.   The nonexistent scope for promotion due to unions demanding promotion be based on tenure forced out anyone who was willing to do more than the bare minimum required. It was a toxic environment for anyone who had the slightest bit of ambition.  The private companies I have worked for on the other hand had nonexistent union membership and the employees were genuinely happier. Management treated the staff well and people were motivated to work as the scope for advancement were clear. I never want to work in a highly unionised company again after my prior experience.
&gt; but too often they can be more harmful than good  I'd argue the opposite.  Unions are overall good, but can sometimes be bad. This is why most European workers see more wages, rights, safety, and security, than their American counter parts.  It's also why British workers get shafted compared to their companions across the pond.
There's lots! I'm just not fully convinced which is worse - a quasi-Stasi like country as pushed by both parties or an anti-science religious Theocracy being pushed by the GOP. Both scare me equally. 
As in an article just above this post - Why hasn't he announced his running for the nomination yet? He's certainly already campaigning. 
  Seniority is important. Don't dismiss that. When you hire in, you get a rate. Then after time you slowly make more money. They can bring in a new worker who will start at base pay. There would never be older workers if that was not policy.  Companies are a bit stupid in that. The cost of hiring is big. Training workers takes time and money.  The quality of work suffers. But they can see the short term profits in exclusion of all else.
And like I said, those legal complications can be resolved via the same rules for limited incorporation. They can hammer out those arrangements as part of the incorporation or settle it in court like any other divorce or bankruptcy.
Imagine that your great grandfather put his blood sweat and tears into a company and he then left the company to your father, who then left it to you. I believe that nearly everyone would accept this as perfectly normal. Well, that's what you have with the Union jobs as well. Their ancestors put the blood sweat and tears into making the organization what it is and they pass those jobs onto their own family.

&gt; I'd rather have capital negotiate with labor or labor's representatives rather than a coalition of capital negotiate with a coalition of labor.  Which is exactly why the Danish worker is so much better off than their American equivalents.  You have nothing to negotiate with, unless you stand together. 1 employee is replaceable, 10.000 employees are harder to replace.
No but at the same time I don't think it's fair to call a look ahead "laughable" just because you've got your fingers in your ears singing lalalala at the consquences
Well, you have stories like the BART (Rail system in San Francisco Bay Area) strike in the bay area, where the union was very clearly saying "We would rather this business go down in flames than not get our way, by the way we want people to be making ridiculous amounts of money to do a job you could train someone to do in about a day."  The big part of that was that the people the strike hurt were mostly people making LESS than what the BART personnel were making. "Oh, you want to make $25 an hour to occasionally resolve a ticket problem, $50 an hour to push a button on a train to make it go to the next stop (It's an elevated tracks, literally a horizontal elevator), and $30 an hour for janitorial services in absolutely filthy stations..."
That was rude he was just asking a question.
Well, unions are extremely strong in Denmark, and they work really well there.  We have even less production than America, and yet somehow unions have still managed to give great benefits to workers all across the country.  Maybe GM had 500.000 employees at their height, and less today, but that doesn't change the fact that if a large part of their employees go on a strike, they lose money. This is true whether you have 500.000 employees, or 50 employees.
Unions suck ass! I was part of a grocery union, no one got more than minimum starting, no raises based on merit or effort, all raises earned on hours worked and its about 8months full time for 10 cent raise. You earned holiday pay, one holiday per year worked there. 2 years before your first week of vacation. The health care we paid for sucked ass. And highest non corporate salary was $45k while the store manager and his assistant made $75k+ with bonuses in the $20-$40k. Our union rep appeared once a month at most made as much as a store manager with an expense account. Worst experience of my life
Let's turn those hugs into votes.
Just for clarification,  female isn't "default." Asexual blob is default and the presence of the Sry gene (regardless of y chromosome) results in males.
But the bible claims to be the word of god, so they can't use that argument.  Once you stop believing in a good portion of the bible, can you even call yourself a Christian?  Bunch of hypocrites!
except, unlike the other entities you mention, unions are democratic.
What I despise is when union contracts specifically say that you're not allowed to hire non-union labor, or the union gets legislation passed that requires obscene training for simple jobs that only the Union can provide. The BART strike in the bay area recently has set the whole area as anti-union.

Seniority is important, but its not more important that doing a good job.  Lots of senior unions workers ive met are lazy and do half asses jobs because they can't be fired easily.   Its a total joke.
The date of the poll was the last week of March, only one month before he officially announced he was running, and well after his free college plans when were introduced well before he announced he was running for President.   Also, it doesn't matter if he entered the race or not, as you can see on that poll, there are numerous other people that specifically said they weren't running for office, polling well ahead of Sanders.  Even so, that poll wasn't about running for President, it was just a general favoribility poll, meaning it has fuck all to do with whether or not a person is running for president, and just a persons general opinion on them. 
But what about their freedumz!? Checkmate unionists.
Sorry about your father. RIP.
&gt; I support the right to choose but I don't understand waiting 5 months.  Unless you're a doctor and your patient has asked for an abortion, your understanding isn't relevant.  Abortion is a medical decision between a woman and her doctor, nobody else should be involved.
"This is why most European workers see more wages" Actually, in the US we see more wages. Unions are nothing more than a different power elite vying for control.  You see it in familial running of Unions (of all the people to run the Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa Jr? Really?)  They might have some benefits, but it sucks more out of workers than it's worth.  If it didn't have built in monopolies in many areas, it would have faded long ago.
 Well if there are lots, then i must be wrong.
Cant help you if you dont understand.  
How about allowing choice?  If the unions are truly that good with only a few bad ones, then those that join will flourish, those that refuse will not.
Hahahahahahahaha, they're all exempt buddy. Their wealth comes from shares of stock, and all they have to do is hold them for 365 days to pay 15% taxes on their profits.  Bernie is going to fuck the upper middle class, watch. Good thing he'll never win
Criminal due process and work place due process are different beasts entirely.    One of them keeps you out of jail, the other one makes it hard to remove bad actors from a work place causing further damage to the economy.
Yes it does you patriot act shill
There are good arguments to be made for the salary negociations of employees to be done at group level, to increase leverage and bargaining power.  Now, on the other hand, in France, unions and subsidies are slowly but surely killing the wine industry.  If you're wondering why french wines are no longer at their top, and californian wines are so much better, think about this.  In France, when the time comes to pick the grapes, union regulations force you to use a "papi".  A "papi" is an old guy who comes to your vineyard and tastest your grapes.  After tasting a few, he will say "not yet" and charge you a few hundred euros for the time.  He'll repeat this for many days, despite it being obvious that there is no way the human palette and olfactory system can be that accurate in determining the key variables.  There is plenty of very affordable technology to determine whether today is a good day to pick grapes: you can measure sugars, acidity and many factors very easily.    But if you don't work with a papi, unions will stop anyone from working at your vineyard and you'll have to pick the grapes yourself.  Combine this with a few highly protectionist rules impeding you to be part of a denomination if you modernise your winery (no pellicular maceration, for example, because your grandfather didn't need to), and state subsidies for quantity rather than quality, and you've essentially got a dead wine industry on your hands that now relies on government to keep it alive.  This is unsustainable and is no good for anybody: lower product quality is a bad thing in itself, but it also mean less wine will be exported, less people will be employable in the sector, less income for producers, less taxes for government, etc.: what was once a great industry slowly slides into mediocrity.
So, one can be a global warming alarmist AND a science denier at the same time?   And wwe're supposed to believe your assessment of the cruzers intelligence?   
So scrap that particular union, and replace it with a new union with better bylaws. The flaws aren't intrinsic to the concept of unions.

I really hope people aren't so hasty as to point to climate change as the cause behind the recent rains in Texas.  1. Weather and climate are not the same thing. The rains are weather.  2. We're observing a known natural phenomenon called [El Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o). This isn't the first time it's happened, and it won't be the last. There's also no reason to expect future El Niño events to get progressively worse, just like there's been no reason to expect hurricane seasons to get progressively worse despite some massive storms a few years ago.
Liberals are so rude. Now we have to end social security because it's time to be "Serious Adults, and make Tough Decisions." Also, the 401K experiment has not been a big enough failure, so we need to implement something similar for health care.
Not 100% wrong, you just over simplified the issue.   Hiring/Trining is expensive so its good to keep a workforce that is trained and experienced.   But that doesnt 100% correlate to seniority.
&gt;if grocery stores cut costs, you'll also see a long-term decrease in the price of groceries  I call bullshit. Unless they MUST due to declining sales from the consequences of mass automation, thye won't cut prices.
There's a chance that the benefits of unions today are outweighed by their drawbacks.

&gt; I can agree to take a temporary pay cut below the minimum wage.   No, you can't.  That's what makes it a *minimum* wage.  
It allows slave labor to be legal by outsourcing to the lowest bidder.
Wait -- the Church isn't doing that.  Secularists, Progressives and other Leftist Activists are mixing politics with Religion by trying to force Christians to accept and approve of what has always been deemed immoral, sinful and wrong -- and always will be according to the Scriptures.  The Church hasn't changed (and those that have are leaving the Scriptures).  So, the "trespassers" are those who seek to force their beliefs on Christians -- not the other way around.  The Romans failed.  The Muslims failed.  The Communists failed.  Do you think you all will have any more luck than they have?  Imprisonment, Crucifixion, Lions Dens, Gladiator Games, Burning at the Stake, Beheading, Gas Chambers -- ??  Good luck.
Only if they ignore the rest of his views on civil rights.     Edit: Since people are hitting the "disagree" button, I'll clarify: He makes noises about the Bill of Rights and the Constitution to placate some of his supporters, but when pressed on a tough question he backs off and says "leave it to the states/market forces will take care of it." He's an anti-Federalist when it suits him, but he supports an amendment banning marriage equality. The Federal Government is not the only source of censorship or oppression, but libertarians seem to miss that point.

True, I'd never assume they were. That said, the stereotypes associated with unions needed to develop from somewhere.
Progress is killing the church.
I still consider myself a Christian, but I do not take the bible literally. I wouldn't say that the significance of the story is to prove anything about God, but to show the faith of Job by illustrating how no matter what happened to him he held strong, and at the end he was rewarded for it.  That's the moral behind it for me, as I read it. Is it absurd? Brutal? Ridiculous? Yes, all of those things. It still a good point of morality.
Aw, it's so cute when neocons try to mask their fear of the poor with hatred.

He can select Supreme Court justices who are against abortion. He can do the same with gay marriage. 
You waged this fifty-year campaign to get us to stop talking about these things, and now that we've tried it your way and we're going back to talking about these things *we're* insane?  Okay. Good luck with that.
&gt;It was Albert Einstein who defined insanity as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”   It was, however, Bill Clinton of "the left" who brought this phrase into the political scene, specifically to critique the policies of his predecessors with regard to the insane idea of trickle down economics (now extended to trickle down politics by the insanity of the supreme troika: duck blind buddy, Heritage husband and no limit head shaker).  It didn't work - then.  It doesn't work - now.  To be clear, the article is focused down on some grumpy disagreement the author has with LGBT rights while the true insanity is America can no longer afford college.  Can't afford to get its teeth fixed.  And can't even move due to "network" limitations imposed by insurance companies.   
It's because GW propaganda uses the exact same psychology of guilt 
Man, if only governments actually followed through with threats to remove tax exempt status of churches that promote political views.
Such a silly rational... and an insult to many peoples intelligence (and yours) by stating that continuing the debate isnt in essence the same as trying to continue it, and not to mention the freedom act is the same as the patriot act. In other words, he doesn't care for ending it no matter how much you love him. And whats even more insulting is this notion that a socialist is going to have animosity towards a big government spy regime. How do you expect socialism to work without first tracking people?
Not nearly as sad as your intellect and profound ignorance of history.
Did you forget which account you're logged into? 
Wtf is this? Are you joking? "Help the poor and love thy neighbor". What kind of shit is this that you think the church doesn't do this? Churches all over my city (and state) provide soup kitchens, shelters, charities, and millions of dollars to homeless and needy and you have the nerve to say american (just to rub it into americans I guess, despite US churches grossing more help and money than any nation's christian churches combined) churches don't do that stuff. Holy fuck reddit can be annoying. Sure complain about the gay marriage thing, but saying the church doesn't pour a ridiculous amount of effort into helping people is just biased anti-christian propaganda. This is such a blatantly bad stereotype of everything it's ridiculous, I doubt you have actually spent any time researching how much the church (regardless of what denomination of christianity) does.  Edit: Added and deleted a couple words.
Let's see... the Bible is supposed to be human/God relations centric... so in the beginning God created the heavens AND the earth. Same sentence. So universe/everything was created, plus Earth. And we're on Earth so that's most relevant to what we need to know. Checks out so far.  Then the sun, then the moon. Hrm, ok, moon is our major light source at night, in all practicality. But it wouldn't be unless there was a sun it could reflect light from... wait... He already created that. He did that first. Ok, still checking out.  Then the stars. Well, what says that when a supernatural being is creating something out of nothing, they have to follow a "in order of size" pattern? Nothing. There's nothing that violates, except for your expectations about how the universe SHOULD be created, in your mind.  Brush up on your logic. You could make plenty of rational arguments about why you don't believe in something, but use proper logic. Your points objectively, are misleading at best and wrong at worst.
Eli5 NSL plz.
Not exactly the most endearing picture....
Human consciousness is the only mode of consciousness we know of that can reflect on consciousness, what it is like, and its miraculous nature--"miracle" here meaning that we are very, very far still from understanding how consciousness comes to be in the brain, whether it is solely located in the brain, and what, exactly, it is. In some Eastern traditions, human mind is the cosmos (God) becoming aware of itself.
He is just stereotyping everyone as the westboro baptist church. That commenter is a bigot himself, and a hypocrite.
All wealth is created in  some form of system funded by taxes. Could you build a system that is some kind of an exception? Sure, I am not saying it cannot be done. I am just saying it would still be a system made of rules and people born into it still couldn't opt for another reality. Furthermore, you didn't earn your money in that system. You earned your money in the one with armies, diplomats, police, roads, sanitation, commerce, regulations, an educated workforce and such. Taxes and property rights are both artificial constructs of this system. Taxation isn't theft because it is as equally valid as the rules that you used to acquire the wealth in the first place. We can change the rules to make taxation theft, but that is just a change of the rules and needs to be argued like every-other change. Does it make the system more productive or more egalitarian? That would be an argument worth hearing, but arguing based on some false sense of natural order is not compelling.  Very few people are willing to tear down what we have and implement a system of  lawlessness poverty.
No, but it helps to explain why some people don't like working for unions and, not unexpectedly, don't like unions.  It isn't a prescription, just an observation, like mine, that we would rather work for places without a union because we liked it better.

  It's common in a lot of practice but it isn't a hundred foot hurdle stopping you from entering the race at all in most cases.
No. I said people are not experts in all they need to be. That includes politicians. I suggest that politicians should listen to *what* people want, not *how* to get it. They should consult people who understand the *how*.
I didn't think I had to cite that, it's pretty common knowledge the gold standard is idiotic. 
I don't favor the involvement of the state in the marriage process. It isn't their business.   (If you're worried, incest and other forms of sexual abuse can be taken care of using penal laws without state regulation of the marriage process.)
&gt; Why do you continue to alienate and persecute millions of Americans because they (have a uterus) own guns?  FTFY  
[Genesis 1:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A28): And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”  Hell of a lot easier to win a conflict if you have more man power.
If an organization requires the government to force people into it in order to function, it's a shit organization and should be disbanded (or at least allowed to die as the few voluntary members eventually peter out)  If that organization was doing something actually beneficial for its members and not just for its leadership/senior members then people would join willingly and it wouldn't be a problem.  The obvious solution is to fix the numerous flaws in the organization, not force people to join it.  
One big reason is also that unions were newer back then.  There were so many problems with workplace safety, lack of regulation, inadequate wages, unfair labor practices, etc.  So unionizing could really only help.  Once many of the problems had been addressed, unions became more similar to the power structures they initially opposed, because they in a sense became the new power structure in organizing labor.  Of course unions are necessary for fighting inequality and injustice, but lets not turn a blind eye to the ways in which some unions have become the evil they originally fought.  The cost of organizing a union should be negligible in the era of mass communication, and yet many people feel that unions take too much money away from their workers.  I do think the way of the future is more unions and more active unions.  But they can only grow in power if they volunteer to give up their economic control over workers.  They need to exist as an ideology and an ideal, and shouldn't mirror the historical oppression of the top-down power structure.  So we need more and more powerful unions, but cheaper.  The cost of ideology must be free, or it becomes a tyranny over the people it purports to watch over.
So, fix it. Be a good steward and simultaneously advocate for your members AND fix the shitty parts of your union.   Or, y'know, get on reddit and bitch.

Well apparently I can't read. 
&gt;If an entire sector negotiates with unions for a standard wage and basic benefits model it is not fair to those companies if they have to compete with companies that ignore the agreements. If a buisness cuts wages below the agreement level with out reason then the unions step in. It dosnt mean that workers cant agree to go down in wage but it has to be for some legitimate reason. I.e. the companies is in trouble or some thing like that.  How does one company beat another then? You're just creating cartels.   &gt;No it is a function of EU laws protecting workers right to work in other EU countries.  Which is literally immigration.
The dizzying amount of money going into corporate welfare, military spending, and waste is more than enough to pay for all these social programs. The US is the richest country in the world, and only getting richer.   It seems weird that it's okay for billionaires and corporations to get so much "for free", but when the the poor majority stands up for himself/herself they are being unreasonable.  It's sad, and it's stupid.
Does that say something about their value proposition then?
You don't really "get" unions, do you? Collective bargaining only works if you have solidarity.
Got to agree here, this is really an issue that has to do with infrastructure, or the proper lack thereof.  
more than the 1% pay today.
&gt; Lets be fair here, the reason for them seeking those exemptions is the stupid 'gold plated' health insurance provision in the bill, that makes health insurance no longer tax deductible if the plan is too expensive.  But Cadillac plans are used heavily by 1%, Wall Street financial elite, Mitt Romney, crony capitalists! I'm outraged as I type this, and can barely contain myself from switching on the caps lock.
The only way rednecks would like that more is if the "Mooselums" were driving a prius... *R.I.P. Pickup*

Want to know something else interesting? When Evangelical Christians first began attempts to create a Moral Establishment in the American government their goal was to defend man from societal detriments they believed originated from rampant, unchecked capitalistic tendencies in the nation. Then the Moral Majority showed up and kinda turned that all on its head.
The FBI doesn't want you to know that they know more than you'd ever think possible. This really isn't news. Is it?  Shit! I made up this complete bullshit story like 15 years ago about killing someone and dumping their body. I've been watched ever since. I can feel it.

&gt;&gt; I would get grief for not taking my coffee break with everyone else.  &gt;If workers start working for free, then management begins to expect it.  If they want you to work more than in the CBA, they should be prepared to pay you more.    Outside of a union they do pay me more because I appear to be an asset that is worth more that what they were paying me.  Inside the union the pay is prescribed and there was no incentive to work harder.  &gt;&gt; The "job security" work was ridiculous. "You can't fix that, it is someone else's job". Infuriating.  &gt;Once again, if you're doing someone else's job, you are putting that job at risk.  Workers gain nothing from eliminating each other's jobs.  If management wants employees to do multiple jobs, they should be prepared to pay extra for that.    Jobs for the sake of jobs is just another broken window fallacy.  If it costs them more time to "do it right" than to get the guy who is there to fix a problem then the union is wasting everyone's time and money.  Increasing efficiency appears to some like eliminating jobs and to others like increasing opportunities.  It is just a matter of interpretation.  In my case I was working tech support but only software.  If the problem involved hardware I would have to call someone else to resolve it.  For the most part that is fine, but when the reason someone's document won't print is because their printer isn't plugged in it goes from a software problem to a hardware problem and involved wasted man hours of work because I can't just plug it in or tell the user to plug it in.  In the end I would usually point out the problem and walk away telling them that I won't report them if they choose to plug it in.  I got remanded once for moving my desktop from the left side of my desk to the right side.  The inefficiency is mind boggling.  &gt;&gt; Unions where you have very low skilled jobs that are easy to fill help because no one individual is valuable enough to negotiate with, but as a group they have more power.  &gt;That's pretty much every industry, regardless of skill level.  That is certainly not true.  In most jobs experience matters, otherwise there would be no raises or promotions in non-union places.  &gt;&gt; How can you say no to teachers or nurses asking for raises when you can just increase taxes to pay for it?  &gt;Politicians seem to have no problem doing exactly that far more often than granting better pay.  It's not like "just raising taxes" is an easy political sell.    Sure, but it is a hard fight because it the employer has, effectively, unlimited money.  The union can always say "they can afford to pay more" because it is always true.    &gt;&gt; when a union demands a raise, the employer can look at their books and see that they will still earn a profit if they pay up to $x, and offer that.   &gt;No.  They're going to fight any wage increase regardless of whether or not they can "afford" it.  No real difference than a public sector employer deciding how to allocate a limited budget.  Obviously they don't negotiate by offering the maximum, but my point is that there is a maximum.  In the public sector there us no maximum, only opinion, because budgets can be increased without limit if so desired.  That is a large part of the battle between political parties, how much to increase budgets.  &gt; Regardless of public or private, though, it's about making sure that workers have representation and that management can't just say "Here's how it is.  Take it or go be unemployed."    As I said, for an employee with no alternate employers this is the problem, and this is why it is complicated.  For most others the alternative isn't just unemployment, it can be to find employment elsewhere, which might be the better alternative if it sucks so much.  I would personally rather negotiate my own income and never join a union again.  I only have to be better than half my peers to be worth paying more than the average.  I prefer to be paid based on my merit, and not some prescribed schedule.  
Well duh. Should have been more like obama and only answer the questions posed by your staffers with with 1 hour old reddit accounts.
"That's true of all jobs though."  You must be talking about a different country. 
I already did.
You're not? Then what's the purpose of what you're saying? Is it not to point out what you feel is wrong with what we believe and bring us over to your side? I mean, you can say you don't care, but the fact that you're using this rhetoric suggests otherwise. I would say don't deny it. I appreciate that you care.
And higher income people benefit from not having 85% of the population pissed off at them because Grandma has to work until she's 90. 
Maybe not, but my union work was a well established private company, one of the largest in the area, and I have since worked for other non union places and never felt as though I wish I my pay was set by the average employee or years of service.  I am lucky in that I work in a high demand, high skill, field where I can easily find work elsewhere if I didn't like my employer.  It gives them great incentive to keep me happy.  So, while my case may be unusual, I believe that my case consistently tells me that a union would not be better for me.  I outlined some cases for unions in some other comments, they just don't apply to me.
Yes. Plus we don't need to be part of it.   You're buying into the whole "let China do It" BS?  Let them.   This whole deal needs to be opened up and strong language inserted to Protect us from these corporations. I guarantee you such language isn't there now.  
Safety usually isn't the reason for unions as OSHA can standup for workers' rights. Wages seem to be the driving force of most unions and there can be different levels of pay between Union and non-Union workers. 
  What union is in place and workers get minimum wage? Not a good union. They are not all the same. The Big 3 auto companies give profit sharing checks. Last Xmas Ford gave 8 thousand buck checks to workers. They know workers are integral to the success of a company.  Profit sharing, what a concept. Corporate profits are at all time highs and workers wages are dropping. Yes, we need unions.

This isn't anything new. Biblical literalism is a fundamentalist and infantile view. The Jewish sages of the Talmudic era almost two thousand years ago were well aware that the Torah couldn't be understood literally. It's not like this view went away, either. A thousand years later around 1100, you have people saying that the tree of knowledge in Eden is clearly figurative, etc. It's not like they never figured out that the  Torah says some pretty horrible things, but they tried to put them in context.  It's memorable enough and makes enough sense for ignorant and entirely uneducated peasants from 2000 years ago to get some value from it (as glue to keep a society stuck together if nothing else), but is still deep enough for people today to get lots of insight out of it. Source: multiple published bible scholars in my family, and while we don't often agree, they are most definitely not stupid people.  Basically, a certain flavor of Christianity came alone that was big on moral outrage and hellfire, and small on knowledge of the hundreds and hundreds of years of religious thought that came before them, and they decided that every word of the bible mush be literally true. They just haven't grown out of it yet. Don't worry, they're all antsy that the world hasn't ended on schedule and Jesus hasn't vacuumed them all up to heaven. Give them 20 more years to figure out that all the Hal Lindsey 20th century Armageddon types were wrong, and they'll start to settle down until the next big revival.
No, unions are not literally the mob.
tl;dr: Rapid growth has not been met with sufficient infrastructural updates and therefore floods.   For one, there is a lack of Central Legislation and funding from the State government that addresses flood control.  The flood control programs for Texas are addressed at the county and city level.  Large infrastructural projects can be massively expensive and overwhelming for a lot of these communities.   The ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) has also given Texas a D- or D each in the categories of Drinking Water, Dams and Flood Water Control.  This isn't to say nothing is being done on this front, for example the Waller Creek Tunnel in downtown Austin was part of updating floodwater systems.  However in the majority of cases the infrastructure has not been adjusted at anywhere near the rate of growth in cities large and small across Texas.   There is also an emerging field or section of infrastructure and city planning studies called "green" or "soft" infrastructure that needs a serious look from politicians; I can give you a bit of information on these approaches if you are interested, I seriously believe they are where we should be focusing our efforts in response to the recent floods along with the ever present issue of overall climate change.    Whether Cruz is a total hypocrite for advocating relief money for one are of the country over the other is another issue.   
I was entertaining his argument on his terms, but if we really want to be nitpicky (seems like it):  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1  Stars are mentioned as being created on the same "day" as the sun and the moon, and no order is mentioned in terms of which of these was created first... or if there was an order in which they were created at all. There is no inaccuracy in terms of age whatsoever. Especially since the term "day" in God's terms (and particularly for creation specifically) can be translated from the Hebrew as simply a period of time regardless of actual literal Earth days.  If we're gonna nitpick, let's actually look at the text before we start making wild claims of inaccuracy.
Seriously, go into McDonald's an negotiate for benefits. let me know how that works out.
What does ISIS or AQAP care? These guys are driven by religious fanaticism more than international politics. Destabilized nations create more conditions for this stuff to well up, but every single person who has attacked the US or other western countries has been educated and from a well-off family. Almost none of them (including all of the 9/11 hijackers and the Boston Bombers) were at all effected directly by any US military or intelligence operations. It's their ideology and religion driving them, and it's going to damned hard if not impossible to kill an idea or concept (jihad) that's been around for 1,400 years. All we can do is defend against it, and simply disengaging from the middle east isn't going to be nearly enough.
[call your congressman here.](http://lobbyism.io/tools/call)  (disclosure: I made this)
That isn't an excuse.  The guy openly supports a great deal of ideas that would set our country back.  His stances on the environment, the major cutting of taxes and government funding for education, the department of energy, and vaccinations.  These aren't small issues.    Also, when exactly has Sanders *not* had a consistent record voting against the very programs that Rand is against? 
Which is what hastert just did too.  Lied to investigators. 
This does not have anything to do with US politics either:  If you have a refrigerator, you can dry-age beef at home.  All fresh beef is aged for at least few days and up to several weeks to allow enzymes naturally present in the meat to break down the muscle tissue, resulting in improved texture and flavor. [Ed: This process is known as _decay_.]  These days, most beef is aged in plastic shrink-wrap—a process known as wet-aging. Dry-aged beef, on the other hand, is exposed to air so dehydration can further concentrate the meat’s flavor. It’s a more expensive process than wet-aging, however, because the meat loses weight from dehydration, and it also must be trimmed of its completely dried exterior.   We dry-aged a previously wet-aged boneless beef rib roast from our local market in one of our test kitchen refrigerators for three days. We had another rib roast from the same steer which we left in its plastic wrap to continue aging for the same amount of time. After roasting, we tasted them side by side. The dry-aged roast was more succulent and had a mellower yet beefier flavor than the wet-aged roast, which tasted watery by comparison. Next, we dry-aged another roast for seven days, and we were blown away by the flavor. Despite the loss of 20% of its original weight, we’re convinced that for a truly special occasion, like a Christmas or New Year’s dinner, dry-aged beef is worth the time and expense. One: Buy a prime or choice boneless beef rib or loin roast from the best meat source in your area.  Two: Unwrap the beef, rinse it well, and pat it dry with paper towels. Do not trim. Wrap the roast loosely in a triple layer of cheesecloth and set it on a rack over a rimmed baking sheet or other tray.  Three: Refrigerate for three to seven days; the longer the beef ages, the tastier it gets. [Ed: Honestly, if you are not going for 14 to 30 days don’t bother.] After the first day, carefully unwrap and then rewrap with the same cheesecloth to keep the cloth fibers from sticking to the meat.  [Ed: You should do this everyday.]  Four: When ready to roast, unwrap the meat and, with a sharp knife, shave off and discard the hard, dried outer layer of the meat. Shave away any dried areas of fat, too, but leave behind as much of the good fat as possible. Roast whole or cut into steaks.   http://www.finecooking.com/articles/dry-aging-beef-pays-off-big-flavor.aspx  
They are like Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish without cunning
Why not?
Which is why it should stop, and why Bernie basically sleazeball his way into voting to extend the patriot act. And these so called great socialist countries, in which many are living a financial ruin, are a great model and very appealing to a peasant who has nothing and expects to achieve nothing. The rest of us have more confident in our self's. 
What an absolute chicken shit response. You're arguing semantics here. I notice you won't acknowledge the first comment I left, where I wrote, "Depending on how many workers your union represents."   I noticed you conveniently chose not to answer the question. You probably better not. I might just rationally explain why the Union brings in that much money. Wouldn't want your idiocy exposed.  What's the old conservative adage? If you don't like your job, get a different one. No one is stopping you.
The .1% of 1% can afford to pay everything out of pocket.  A lot of people who make $400000 also live in extremely expensive cities like NYC SF and LA.  So they actually need more than decent health insurance, and they pay more for it.  Also they tend to be older and under high stress, so they also could suffer catastrophic health issues more. class warfare never works,  see the UK in the 60s and 70s. 
Google it. I'm not gonna link any one piece because then people whine about the source instead of the issue at hand. http://imgur.com/nO904Cq but there are plenty of results and explainers on the web
I love how the article title seems to solely place Rand Paul as the only one who can stop it even though their are others that are standing against it.
He's trying everything to distance himself from his brother to secure the moderate vote, but that's the only part of him that attracts the republican base.
In some cases that's when you find out the fetus has severe defects, meaning that it either won't survive to be born or will have a very poor and/or short (and terribly expensive) life if it does.
He's not stupid, he just wants the appearance of being against the Patriot Act, while actually being for it.  This way he can say he voted against it, since he knows almost all of the 60 votes for cloture will vote for it. It's pretty smart actually.
And my position is there was a law restricting that until it was struck down by the Supreme Court.  And there is no law that XYZ must decide that at their annual shareholders meeting. There have been attempts to make that a requirement supported by law, but they have died under republican Congresses, just as laws requiring disclosure have.
&gt; the industries that unions worked for were stronger  Of course that is the answer, but Reich's red herring is supposed to delay the masses from the realization that middle class and lower class, unskilled labor will never come back to the US with the wage advantages it used to have.  More importantly, however, is the fact that the inequality or equality between everyone in the US, except the top 0.05% has been the same since they've been tracking such things ~ 1916. There is no additional inequality between the income quintiles - zero  -  and the gains in the top 0.05% have not come at the expense of the lower groups.  It's all class warfare propaganda - lap it up. 
Pretty sure you have to take an oath to become president, no.
Rand Paul is going to save the universe.
I don't give a shit if you don't click the link. The image surmises my thoughts perfectly, and I'm pretty sure your just the latter part of the meme now.
This is r/liberal for a reason.
He's killing it right now
Why I consider myself a conservative (actually a hybrid of conservative and libertarian which I call conservatarian): I am trying to preserve the a way of life uniquely created at the founding of our nation - empowering the individual over the self serving desires of the collective. The expansion of the "social compact" threatens this.  The US was the first nation to empower the individual. The first nation to say: you, the individual, have rights not granted by government (kings - given the time) but by the very nature that you are a human being and that no government (or society) can take those rights away from you.   &gt; When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  &gt; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to  There are some very important concepts in those words, and this was the first time in recorded human history that a government was created based on these ideas. The idea was to limit what government could do, because it will always try to do too much, so as to protect the rights of the citizens.  We (as an entire nation) haven't been very good keeping to these principals because we (as a nation) too often pursue our interests over living up to the higher standard our principals require.  A prime example was the allowance of slavery to exist in some parts of the new nation, the Declaration is quite clear that "All [people] are created equal" and have certain irrevocable rights - but at the time, the interests of holding the colonies together trumped this basic principal and has remained as a cancerous black mark on our nation's soul. Historical fact: the "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" explicitly mentioned in the Declaration was originally "life, liberty, and property"; but the framers were worried that this would be construed as a fundamental right to own another person.  I'd be happy to have a respectful dialog with anyone regarding such things. All you have to do is ask!
She never polled over 50% in 2008. [Link](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html)
considering how unions have lost essentially all of their power, and how much workers have suffered as a result, I really don't care! If corporations can use underhanded tactics without any *real* opposition, then fuck it, let unions play the dirty political game.  the rights of workers trump all in this case, at least to me.
woot!
&gt; Another problem with unions is the requirement to belong. Any organization is strengthened when it's members belong voluntarily and weakened when membership is compulsory.  I'm pretty sure the reality is the exact opposite - unions crumble when they don't have that requirement to belong.  It's why we have a law in Canada that says if part of the workforce is unionized, then the *entire* workforce pays dues.  Unions just wouldn't work without that law.
&gt; You cannot say you believe the Bible and maintain that Darwinian evolution occurred.  Absolute nonsense.   The Bible is not creationism.  Genesis is a parable, not an anthropology text.  The Church's biggest problem is they turned the Bible into a false idol in violation of the First Commandment, then turned their "Bible believing" religion into a bizarre combination of hyper-paranoid evangelism and rigid every-man-for-himself political fanaticism.  There is almost no Christianity to it any more.
Work on that grammar, and they will take you more seriously in the boardroom.
By going to your ISP the FBI can more easily track all your online identities, even anything you might think is anonymous (say anon posting on 4chan) or pseudononymous (like reddit).   Basically by using the ISPs records they can link all your posts all across the Internet way more easily.  But as /u/cannabaceae said, they can't see what you encrypt. That's why you should at least be using a VPN, preferably one that has servers in another country. Your ISP will only see your connection with the VPN.
Why it exists is not relevant to those that were born 20-30 years after its inception.  If you're going to sell me on unions(and Ive been in a few) as more that just another money grab taking 50-100$ off each pay check then I want to see what they are doing for me lately.   I'm not inherently anti union in any sense but like everyone in this thread I want to see some value for my money, and bringing up history(while important) does not show me value here and now.
Greece, Ireland and Portugal all have unemployment rates above 14 percent. Wealth in these countries is extremely low. In the case of Portugal, GDP per capita in 2010 was just $25,575, lower than every country in the developed world except Slovakia. And what about the disaster the socialist French party has done to their countries economy.    The small country of Sweden, with high immigration standards, has had a relatively good recovery, so ill credit you with that.
I think it's reasonable to want to expose why these idiots don't even deserve the chance to run. 
He was talking exclusively about the phone metadata collection program which was started supposedly under the authority of 215 of the Patriot Act.
No he was on CSPAN2 (the live feed from the Senate) saying the PATRIOT act was on Obama. He did not specify that he was talking about any parts of it. I was just told it was showing a recording of Rand talking since the Senate took a recess without doing anything, but the comments were in context. No mention of any specific parts of the act, just that the act is Obama's problem.
That, and the top marginal rate was like 99%..  ...Back when "millionaire" actually meant something, as in "I just made 100 million, and then give 99% of it up in taxes" millionaire. 
Yet, somehow they are able to mobilize a huge block of voters.  Also, by that reasoning, there probably has never been a Christian. Especially now, after a thousand years at least of causing pain and suffering how can the people who inherited a religion that isn't full of Christians themselves be Christian?  Edit: Romans 3:23 tells me that they are all Christians. There is not a No True Scotsman argument because Christian doctrine accepts all who profess to be Christians and offers forgiveness to everyone who sins. Which is everyone according to the doctrine.
Ooooohhhh KAY.  Well, you head on back over to FOX news. This nonsense plays well over there.  Over here in reality, though, you are speaking gibberish.
Sounds like it's the rule, and not the benefits of the union, keeping the union in place. 
I don't know, but it's becoming a bizarro version of a presidential term. With him wanting to keep the act as is, and letting Shell start drilling in the Arctic, I really don't understand what Obama is doing anymore.

That's his answer to every question. Robert, why do chocolat chip cookies taste so good? Unions. 
I couldn't say how the Walker or the the state arrived at that number other than to say the state will have a [$283M deficit](http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/fiscal-bureau-projects-283-million-deficit-at-the-end-of-this-fiscal-year) by the end of the year.  They originally wanted $300M which would have fully covered the gap.
It's not doing politics any favors either.
I imagine most union workers already make more than $15/hr. It's an incentive to unionize for both the employer and the employees, and then a 'fair' minimum wage can be set / negotiated.   Some businesses might not legitimately be able to pay that wage, for example a independently owned McDonald's. So the employees unionize, the owner tells / shows them how its impossible to pay $15, but agrees to $11.25 which is up whatever % from the old flat minimum wage prior to the increase. Because the union is settling for less than the minimum wage, they demand longer shifts and more days off in a row, plus a week of paid vacation.

On the Patriot act filibuster? What a scumbag move.  Don't try to spin this around too much. Either he supports it but knows it's unpopular with his constituents so he votes no knowing it will still pass, or he wants to score political points on one of the most unconstitutional and intrusive acts passed by congress and risk it actually passing.  Disgusting either way
There are two sides to a debate.   If one side had 30, and the other has 30, and both of them vote for cloture so that they can move on to vote, they collectively have 60 votes to end the debate, and 30 each to vote for/against the bill..   This is simple fucking math.
I agree that most of them probably think they're right, but at the same time they may have difficulty articulating an actual reason why. They love external justification because it spares them the cognitive dissonance that occurs when somebody challenges them.
I live in PA and we have teacher unions. Oy! I am not as much of a fan of public unions because politicians will just make any deal when spending other people's money. Teachers here regularly get into a six figure salary for 9 months of work, get every legal holiday off no matter how inane, full taxpayer funded pensions, retirement eligible after 30 years (in most cases 54 years old) and you can't get rid of the bad ones! Not all of them mind you, but we have many that are just flat out over compensated. I saw fortune rank the best public schools in the nation and PA only had a handful (literally like 5) make the top 500. The vast majority were southern schools. We just spend too much on teachers and not enough on education.  That being said, I am very pro union when it comes to the private sector, and I think public employees should get some sort of average of that.
While unions are conceptually a good thing, they do have their downsides. Canadian here. Unions can make it impossible to fire shitty employees, and since everything tends to be seniority based rather than merit based, shit rises to the top pretty easily.
Ypu really think the working conditions s on farmland was much better? Where they had to work the same hours with the possibility that their farmland wouldn't produce enough to support them?    Sure the conditions were bad compared to now but you need to compare it to before which wasn't all nice and cozy.  The reason we have the benefits like the 40 hr work week is because our economy is multiple folds more productive/efficient than it was during this time. Working conitions and safety were already vastly improving even before the unionization, even though they like to take credit for it.    Simple experiment, imagine going back to the technology at that time, do you think we could support the population today with only working 40 hours a week? 
Well, from my experience, evolution is a more hazy theory than gravity.   Just my background, I grew up in a Christian family and I gave up my faith when I started attending university. I guess I never truly believed in a God. However, I started attending church on my own will and attending numerous lectures about this issue. Not only the Christian God, but having a God in the universe in general.  What Christians have a problem with is historical evolution, that humans and animals evolved from a single ancestor.  Christians (the ones I know) have no problem with "short term" evolution. Imagine there is a population of brown squirrels and an earthquake separates them geographically. On one land, it is advantageous to be colored orange, while on the other land, it is better to be colored black. Over several (hundreds) of generations, one population is orange and one is black because of natural selection.   Both short-term evolution and gravity are observable and there is hard evidence, hence "hard science."  Historical evolution (humans evolved) takes more of a leap of mind to reach. Given, I will say the current level of evidence researched makes it MOST likely that humans evolved; so the current "popular" theory is that we evolved as humans. However, there is so much more to be researched.   On the other side, it is indeed entirely possible a God may exist, even if the CURRENT level of research may point in a different way. 
The other part of the reason that people view unions negatively in terms of corruption and mafia links is that they actually had and still do have massive amounts of corruption and did have massive amounts of mafia links.  So, there's that.  Furthermore, people still view unions negatively now because the biggest unions are the public sector unions, which cost all of us massive amounts of money for pork barrel jobs at best, and have failed multiple generations of students (in the case of the teachers' unions) at worst.  So, there is that as well.
The one time I got extremely angry was a while back was a post on /r/politics saying how there was a disparity between pay for Senate and House cafeteria workers in DC. One was unionized, the other wasn't.   The one that wasn't was prevented from unionizing by *another union* who sued saying that the union they were unionizing with had an agreement that it wasn't their territory (even though they represented the workers on the other side of the hill). Then the union which took the time to sue **never went back to unionize the workforce which had already voted to unionize** just saying it was  [on their radar and they would eventually get around to it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/05/why-house-cafeteria-workers-are-paid-better-than-senate-cafeteria-workers/).
&gt;Seniority is important.  Actually, it's absolutely irrelevant. Any value it gives you should be reflected in a greater ability to do the job at hand.   
Based on your comment, I think we're on the same side of this argument.  Please note that I also stated it would be wrong to force the pastor to conduct the ceremony.  I probably could have stated in better, my intention was that the pastor has every right to refuse to conduct the ceremony, but that his views might be misguided.  BTW, fully support your pops refusing to marry couples if he doesn't think they should be married, if he would rather be playing golf that day, just doesn't wanna do it, whatever.
Because many employees have little interest in joining unions and forcing someone to join a union is not fair. If there exists a subset that want to fight for the improvements and believe in the union then let them do so. Life's not fair either way. On one end you have the union members complain the non members will benefit. Vice versa forcing all employees into a union they don't want to be a part of isn't fair either. I'd prefer the freedom to not join one than have no decision in the matter.
Because it's an employer's market. If they aren't handed enforced regulations *or* collective bargaining to fight against, then they can very well demand low pay because there are enough potential employees that *need* employment that it's a non-issue for them to find workers willing to settle for sub-optimal pay.   This drives *down* wages and there's no way to enforce a higher standard without collective bargaining or else widespread regulation.  Individuals wanting the power to make that decision actually and unintentionally gives the employers the power.
That isn't what I said... You should perhaps work on your reading comprehension skills and I'll work on my communication skills. What I'm saying is the morons who are running on the republican side (with the exception of Rand Paul) are absolutely atrocious presidential candidates and any debate with Bernie Sanders would expose that immediately. 
Or they needed an attack on the nation to push us into a war with public support.   Look at what happened next, they knew what was going to happen, they ran risk vs reward and felt 3k of American lives would be worth getting control of the middle east energy reserves. 
There is a difference between slave labor and a system similar to indentured servitude.
You're right. The Westboro Baptist Church despises faith. *scoffs*  Keep deflecting reality. See how that works out.
The government doesn't force people to join a union. The government recognizes the union's contract with the employer. If a union negotiates 'only use union labor' then that employer should only be using union labor. If you don't want to join a union you can find work at a non-union shop.
Thankfully old man Bernie will not be president. He hasn't met a government problem he doesn't like.
No, it's because it hasn't been finalized.  Negotiations are still ongoing, so they choose to not release the thousands of drafts they have.  That would be counterintuitive.
If you look at the actual statistics in terms of affiliation, membership, and church attendance, it's not the crazy evangelical conservative churches that are losing members. In fact they're the only ones experiencing growth. It's the older more established mainline protestant and liberal catholic churches that are drying up.  This trend is prevalent not just in the US with respect to Christianity, but in most of the world with most religions.
I think if Paul became president we would have someone less schooled in macroeconomics than my cousin in highschool running a country.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I'm happy for you that you found the answer that you were looking for.  And yes, it seems fascinating to me that our communication styles could be so misaligned.   For example, my point has consistently been that your question, as you stated it, was not answerable. If it makes no sense, it cannot be answered. So I get the sense that you, with your website, when encountering a question like that, you don't try to correct misconceptions? You even see any attempt to correct such misconceptions as unhelpful? Instead, you answer what cannot be answered? How does that work?  Your approach would be:          Q: Why is the sky made out of Democracy?         A: Because the French Revolution       That seems to be what you're saying. But that also seems entirely absurd, so I'll just assume that I have, once again, misunderstood your words.   Perhaps if you shared the answer that you found, that would shed light on what you actually meant with your original question.
I'm asking you to look at how NAFTA has effected workers in both the US and Mexico.   How has it benefitted the rich?   Have they gotten richer?  These are the questions we should ask ourselves.   Yes I can buy a cheap cell phone to type this message to you, but I will likely never own a farm or maybe not even a house.   The system has been shifted to benefit only certain groups of people and their acolytes.   Read up brother.   
Agreed.
A TED talk isn't going to solve this problem, but I'd like to hear Sanders' solution. We had plenty of trouble with terrorism in the past, long before 9/11:  Kenya:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_United_States_embassy_bombings  France:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_8969  Syria:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Azbakiyah_bombing  Saudi Arabia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khobar_Towers_bombing  Kuwait:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Kuwait_bombings  Yemen:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Yemen_hotel_bombings  Lebanon:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_embassy_bombing  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon_hostage_crisis  Egypt:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_massacre  United States:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing   One thing all of those countries have that Afghanistan doesn't are strong central governments and mostly modern education systems. The common thread, through all of the attacks, is religious extremism inspiring acts carried out by tight cabals. How do we solve that problem, or defend against it?
It's great and all, but let's be honest...
It means that if there are any disagreements of thought between the professor and the university they can't just fire him.  It sounds weird and maybe unfair, but it takes a massive amount of academic effort to be a professor and then even more effort to receive tenure. The safety of tenure is that as long as the professor is good at teaching and research (his actual education job) it shouldn't matter what they (legally) think/do.   This means their position is a highly educated and high level position with a lot of job security. This makes their opinion more reliable, less biased, more informative, and more sought out then many other professionals.   The problem starts to rise though when (lets say) the president and top administration of the university UW are bleeding heart liberals and a math professor is a staunch conservative and the professor happens to be political, perhaps works with local politics or is some sort of economic adviser. The liberal staff may find it politically convenient to find another professor to replace him. Or maybe they want to discredit him. But they cant because of his tenure.  There may also be differences of opinion on how to fund parts of the university. Maybe the administration wants to fund the business school more than the sciences, well now they can't fire the tenured professors who will disagree.  **The Point:** Professors are too educated and too few to have to bend to the opinions of the ever changing administration above them to have to fear for their careers just because there's a difference of opinion. What it ends up doing is giving professors much more say in how a university is and will be run, which is a great thing since the professors ARE the academic side of the university including the academic administration.  The rest of the administration(including the president) is really only the funding and public image/advertising side so they shouldn't have very much control over the actual schooling anyway.   This also has the benefit of keeping outside money from influencing individuals job security as well.
Or ones that are corrupt?    My grandparents were in a shoe makers union. The union bosses and company management vacationed together. When my grandmother had cancer the union health insurance initially wouldn't pay for it. Eventually they did but only the first time. If she got cancer again they wouldn't cover it again. Fortunately the cancer waited until she was on Medicare before it returned.   They worked from roughly 1915 to 1968. Their union pension was about enough to cover the electric bill. 
I talked about how blatant it is that they're not separated, so I see your comment as a point in favor of that argument. 
Bernie Sanders talks a good game but he didn't lift a finger in this entire surveillance debate.  He didn't show up to filibuster with Rand Paul while other Democrat Senators did.  Socialists and Communists ultimately want a surveillance state, how else will they know if you're "contributing" or not?
He could also put some in place that are against mass surveillence. Aren't hypotheticals fun?
I can name lots of specific reasons why unions are bad and how they are extortionists. Look at the LA dry wall union that controls the Denver market. They will picket your building if you don't use dry wall Union workers because they are far more expensive than private small businesses. They berate you and picket you simply because they can not compete in the market place. Instead they will hire people who don't even work for the union to picket your building and shaming you publically. How about the plumbers Union in Denver as another specific example?  It's the good old three strikes and you're out rule, which happens to reset EVERY 30 days and you start fresh. So basically you have a bunch of guys who show up drunk to the job because they can get away with it because it will all be forgotten and forgiven with 30 days. I know lots of plumbers who left because of this reason and went to private businesses because they were sick of putting up with the bull shit.  
Christianity is killing Christianity. 
EXACTLY! I'm tired of the circle jerk around this guy. He helped the bill get passed. The guys an authoritarian who wants to concentrate all power at a federal level so that he can force his ideals on every state.   Makes you wonder how many bills he's "voted against" just to save face.
No, it's merely the tragedy of the commons.  Unions provide a *collective* benefit.  So the membership should be collectively regulated, and the cost collectively distributed too.  The membership may even largely agree that the union is providing a benefit, while individually neglecting to pay for that benefit, because if you can get something for free, why pay?  Especially if you are in a low income bracket.
So having down votes makes you run away? Maybe you need to grow up a little if you care so much about being down voted.
99%?  Well then, they should love Bernie Sanders' low low proposed tax rate of only 90% (I know ***I love it***)!
oh look another voice to the group pretending a trade deal being negotiated like this is new and sinister.  why can none of these people, even with the leaked text, point to the part that is bad?   Should be easy...
Just a theory, I didn't think I needed to mention that.  And my username is irrelevant. Lots of intelligent people have ridiculous usernames.
And this is part of the problem - how easy it is to read 2 different meanings in to the same text that both sound reasonable, and how that allows unscrupulous people to use it to push their agenda. 
When does the vote happen? My guide is showing that cspan is switching to other programming soon.
I'd like to be surprised or outraged by this, but sadly this is exactly what I've come to expect from Ted Cruz.  
Justification from some independent authority that is assumed to always be right, by definition. I think all beliefs that aren't subject to scrutiny are bad.
Or they'll pass it at the last second.  You think that the NSA hasn't compiled enough data on the holdouts to destroy them and their families utterly?  This is just for show.  They want to make We the Peasants think that someone in Washington still fights for them, but deep down, all of us understand that nothing could be further from the truth.
Lol. I liked Sanders until he pulled this stunt. Look through my comment history. If he gives an explanation for voting for cloture let me know, until then I have absolutely no interest in hearing the hive-mind's circle jerk for him and their presupposed apologetics for his actions. 
I don't think it's fair to expect the people who have lost loved ones and property to be thinking politically right now. They are victims in need of aid, just like hurricane sandy victims. It's not their fault that they have complete asshats for political leaders 
Constantine built the BRAND, not the RELIGION or the FAITH. So, I suppose you could say that Constantine, more than Jesus or Paul, is the central historical figure in mainstream to evangelical Protestantism today.
&gt; So having down votes makes you run away?   Having downvotes makes your comments invisible, which makes commenting pointless.  Having downvotes forces you into a ten minute delay between replies, which makes conversation impossible.  Maybe you should make an attempt to know what the hell you're talking about before you start running your mouth.   
They [company goons] actually *do* kill people, who try to form unions in places like South America, at Coca-Cola factories.
Let's put your statement to the test in a whole other context: regulation of fisheries.  You have a fishery that is being overfished, to the point of collapsing the resource.  The government decides to enact regulations to preserve this resource, regarding how many fish can be caught.  But they make these recommendations *voluntary*.  Without these recommendations, the fishery will surely collapse.  But every fisherman is trying to provide for his family, and every company is trying to turn a profit.  Is it in anyone's individual interest to adhere to the recommendations?  Of course not.  So everyone ignores the rules, and collectively they destroy their resource.  This is the tragedy of the commons.   Since unions provide a collective benefit, collective membership rules are nothing more than a regulation in everyone's best interest, precisely because they can be enforced, removing free riders.  I may want to pay my dues, but *only if* I know I'm getting my fair share of benefit out of them, and knowing they are not going to cover the benefit share of the five or six deadbeats who aren't paying theirs.
Is Bernie Sanders starting to seem like an unstoppable juggernaut to anyone else?
Fuck off McCain and just retire already. The leader blocked Paul from speaking so McCain and Coats could jerk each other off
Wait, so it's poor twentysomethings who are responsible for their parents' and grandparents' approval and promotion of the asinine policies that led to the decline of unions, the squeezing of the middle class, and ultimately a lack of education on union issues?  I understand and agree with your point--the whole blame politicians meme is way overplayed, as in most cases, it's the American people who allowed everything to get so bad. But how about not shitting on those who are clearly victims of 30-40 years of stupid policies resulting from elections they weren't able to participate in?
And how much take home pay?
Meh, I'm fine with leaving gay marriage to the states. People can move. Not a popular opinion, but I think as more states start legalizing it, it'll become less of an issue.  Abortion, he says he wants to leave to the states too, but I'm not as keen on that one since illegal abortions will continue and cause more health issues for the mothers.
Make businesses pay employees $15/hour and then swoop in and offer the businesses a cheaper alternative if they use union labor. This really is crooked.
 We moved our manufacturing to foreign lands, lock ,stock and intellectual property. It was not for the benefit of unions, workers, or for America. It was so corporations and the one percent could make short term profits at levels that were unheard of before. 
I think the point is that you need to back up claims with sources when making claims that slander someone's reputation, especially in a public forum like this and when discussing someone whom the vast majority of his supporters feel has more integrity than any candidate we've seen in our lifetimes.  So for someone to come in, make a wild claim that lumps him in with 99% of other politicians in Washington, and then say "It's just my opinion" without any kind of factual backing... Well, that's a bit dishonest and unfair.
Grumpy grampa is grumpy. 
&gt; How is that problem unique to unions?  It's not, just more common in them.
Isn't that basic knowledge taught in schools though? I wouldn't expect someone to give me proof 2+2=4 when it's common knowledge. But, just in case, here's a some info about how our solar system formed and the ages of various things in it, with a ton of references, and loads of links you can follow to find out about the ages of other galaxies and stars in the universe. If you've really never been taught this in school, you'll probably find it quite enlightening.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Formation_and_evolution
 So giving all jobs to the newest graduates from high school and college, is the right thing to do.?You are one of those who think a company owes workers absolutely nothing. No respect. no security. Nothing.    There was a time when we thought if a company was successful, you as a worker would also be. Now I see, you are just to be used as coldly and as rudely as possible. 
Which didn't rise to the level of an impeachable offense. He lied about a sexual affair with a consenting adult. You would have just fessed up to that one on record? No. You try to protect your family. Almost twenty years later and people are still trying to claim it wasn't a witch hunt. Pathetic. 
The USA Freedom Act, which ostensibly places limits on the bulk surveillance programs.
To biologists, there is no difference between the two cases, what you might have heard called *micro*evolution and *macro*evolution. All evolution is is a change in allele frequencies from one generation to the next, and preventing that is impossible under natural conditions. The polymerases copying genes make mistakes that inevitably accumulate over time.  Creationists are forced to take the position that, if humans and other living things do not actually share a common ancestor, their genes look precisely as we'd expect them to look if they did. Humans and chimps not only share ~99% of our DNA, those genes are in the same order on *syntenic blocks*. The only major difference is in our Chromosome 2, which is split into two smaller ones in them. Why, if a creator is making this all from scratch for every species, would they put all the genes in the same order, then change things in only a few simple steps, as evolution would? Is the gift of rational thought supposed to lead us to conclude damnable lies?   I would point out that science does not aim to disprove God, nor can it. You cannot ask God to submit to experiment. All science does is point out what is possible naturally, without need for divine intervention.
  I have known a lot of teachers in my life. I don't know any that were not dedicated to teaching and wanting to do a good job.  I suppose bad teachers exist, but they don't get to stay on the job. These many cases are just a song and dance that the media has propagated. Teachers, the post office and civil workers are 3 huge unions. The wealthy are in the process of breaking them. They will succeed, because people like you buy into their crap. 
[deleted]
"I don't remember this happening, therefore its correlated with climate change." Ehhh...
Government employees work on a standardized pay curve that applies the same to everybody. How else are teachers supposed to negotiate their pay, except in an organized fashion?
If Cruz doesn't care what scientists say about science, why would he care what they say about politics? 
  That is a starting job. They see what kind of worker you are and if your attitude and attendance is good. Then you get moved up.
As a Spaniard, I see the opposite, too many unions harming the economy.
 You assumption. not mine. I do not know.
Yes, they are union jobs...  It sounds like the union is suppressing the supply to keep the prices up.
This is referring to /r/anybodyButHillary OP is a militant Hillary supporter and will not tolerate dissent.  I suppose that the assumption is that Hillary is somehow a liberal and that her election would somehow benefit America more than any of the conservatives, and that liberals should all just play ball and bow down to their party apparatchik masters.  All I have to say to that is no. I don't want endless war. I don't want corporate rule. I don't want another corrupt president. I don't want leftward opposition to become even more neutered than it was under Obama.  I don't consent for you to make my political decisions for me or for anybody else.
I don't really have an opinion on taxing cadillac plans, I was just pointing out how it's the devil when rich folks use it, and therefore we must tax, tax, tax; and how it's suddenly a must-have for simple just like you and me $400,000-a-year-earning folks next door when unions get involved.  But a serious question, though - with ACA enforcing maximum out-of-pocket costs per individual and per-family, what's the point of a cadillac plan, as opposed to, let's say, platinum plan bought off Obamacare exchange?
Society should be progressive. A society deserves to have certain things taken for granted as it improves, and should be able to continually improve the standard of living for its citizens without forcing them to fight for every scrap. 200 years ago, the infrastructure and capability to help people didn't even exist, so it would be unfair and questionable to make a comparison.
Why is it just that simple? Should we find out why he voted this way? You know maybe he has a legitimate reason. I'm not staying your wrong just that you are completely assuming why he did what he did. 
No. You can deny science all you want but you don't get to own the facts.
All things I completely agree with. He isn't against civil rights at all. He just doesn't think the federal government should be involved in them. Which is exactly the way our nation was originally intended.
&gt; The Bible is not creationism.  I never said it was. I never stated my personal position on the subject.  &gt; Genesis is a parable  No it isn't. By definition it isn't a parable. In fact, not one book of the Bible is a parable. A parable would be the Prodigal Son. Parables are the stories Jesus told.   &gt; not an anthropology text  I didn't say that it was. You assume too much. It is a historical narrative theologically speaking. If you refuse to look at it under the scope of theology, and ignore exegesis, it can only be fiction. It certainly is not a science book. In the Hebrew, it is clear that each to it's own *kind* is specific enough to mean just that and only that. I won't read into the text, and you don't read into my words, m'kay?  &gt; The Church's biggest problem is they turned the Bible into a false idol in violation of the First Commandment  That is the second commandment. An idol is a tangible (carved) object btw. The Hebrew (and many translations) is specific here.  &gt; then turned their "Bible believing" religion into a bizarre combination of hyper-paranoid evangelism and rigid every-man-for-himself political fanaticism.  Essentially, this is Christian Zionism.  &gt; There is almost no Christianity to it any more.  I agree. Actually, we probably agree on more than you seem to realize. Don't knee jerk. You are just illustrating my points. Ugh.
Maybe that's how you feel about it. I agree with his ideas on social issues.
He won't answer this because there is no answer to this.
Way to drop down to the lowest common denominator then just keep on digging. 
Man, chill out.  Sorry for chatting with you.  You live up to your handle.
Yeah, leaving civil rights to the states is great, I love not being able to marry in Ohio.  And politician not in favor of gay marriage doesn't have a moral compass.
That should meet the US government efficiency standards then. 
I didn't categorize the things, I just copy pasted the relevant things from the civil rights category on that page.
He wasn't impeached for either of those reasons.    He was impeached for **not** being a conservative. 
&gt; but I think as more states start legalizing it, it'll become less of an issue.  It won't be an issue when the supreme court rules in favor of equality.  &gt;Meh, I'm fine with leaving gay marriage to the states. People can move. Not a popular opinion  not a popular opinion because it's bigoted  
What are you even talking about? Are you high or something?
&gt; filibuster  There was no filibuster.  Sanders has a record of being against the Patriot Act for years. 
Good, mix it more then. 
They should have all the candidates partner with the WWE and sponsor a 20 person battle royale match. All the candidates of both parties enter the ring and the last one standing wins not only the democratic AND republican nominations but also a shot at the heavyweight title.
The Bible isn't in Latin. It's in Hebrew and Greek.  To your point, well, we don't have to depend on other people's interpretations. But that's like saying "I know how to be an aerospace engineer because I can read the words in textbooks about it." All of the antitheists downvoting me so hard here have not taken the time to delve into the Bible as much as theologians and biblical scholars, who know classical Greek and Hebrew and can read the text untranslated as well as tie it into its historical context. Translations are not perfect, as anyone who has ever read something in its original and its translation knows.
Some people feel that our laws should be based on the votes of congress rather than procedural bullshit.
And we can and easily will have 10 times the current population soon enough. We have space, resources and technology to grow the human race. We shouldn't be scaring people with fantasies of Global Warming based upon models and denial of science.
Well I'm sorry to hear homosexuality bothers you so much.
That happens in non-union shops as well.   That's a humanity problem, not a union problem.
GOP rules say that if the candidates participate in debates outside the officially sanctioned GOP debate schedule they are banned from all further GOP debates?  Maybe he wants to debate Gary Johnson or something?
You might want to rethink [Rand Paul.](http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2015/03/27/only-on-brody-file-video-rand-paul-says-its-time.aspx)   If you need more, just google David Lane. Not only is Lane one of his principal advisers, Lane's daughter is on Paul's senate staff. Both she and Rand's wife worked for one of Lane's major supporters. 
The public wasn't bamboozled, they simply say back and watched as unions grabbed more and more rope and then hung themselves.   Anyone who knows anyone that was a teamster or UAW in the 70s and 80s knows the stories. There is a good reason punch-out clocks were replaced by biometric time clocks. There is a good reason that the best euchre players were UAW workers. But the workers were the least of the problem, the management is a corrupt stew of politicians and gangsters.   Don't ever let anyone make you think that labor unions were some benevolent organizations of the people and for the people, they were greedy and selfish to the point of killing themselves off instead of giving in for the greater good of the company, the community, and themselves.  Now that the federal government has adopted the best result from the labor movement - safety standards, there is no more need for "organized labor." other than to recycle taxes into democrat politicians and gangsters pockets.  The class warfare "inequality" propaganda is bullshit - just look at the data. The top 0.05% or so have done better than everyone, true, but not at the expense of US workers and everyone else, the 99.95% (of workers) have stayed relatively equidistant from each other for nearly 100 years. The 2nd 20% is making about the same, relatively as the forth 20%, etc. The gains at the top have not come from the US, but from the expansion of global markets.
The livestream in the other thread went offline, this is the current cspan livestream. 
gotta protect their puppets 
unions arent the best idea but they are the best option..
Funny how Bernie only seems to care when it's going to be other peoples money.
It truly is Socialism for the rich and Capitalism for the poor.
You obviously were not following what happened. this entire past week.  By senate terminology he did not filibuster, yet he procedurally delayed the reauthorization and any votes on the USA Freedom act.  Sanders did NOTHING.  Saying you're against something and doing something about it is completely different.  Sanders wants the USA freedom Act, which is patriot act lite, it still authorizes bulk data collection.  Last time they voted on the USA freedom Act, they almost hit the 60 vote threshold, good thing they didn't and GOOD THING Rand Paul delayed the entire process.  The bulk data provisions of the patriot act is due to expire in 5.5 hours and it will have been all because of everything Rand Paul did in the last week and none of it will be because of Sanders.  So much for being against something for so many years, what good has he done?
I couldn't help but notice you chose not to address the veracity of the piece.
But not enough to do anything. 
Or that chipotles are being embedded under our skin so the government can track our movements! !!!!!!!!  Ninja edit: needed more !!
How would we ever know, before there is an equal opportunity for women in the workplace, so we could find out?  Maybe the reason for the pattern Adriana Huffington noticed is that journalism is a particularly unfair field for women. What's your source for that attribution?  Regardless, my comment is no less true.
It's early but his message really resonates with young people, even though the media says he only resonates with old people. I'm like....what old people are they talking about? It's a blatant misdirection...
The company owes their employees nothing except the wage they promise in exchange for the service their employee provides. The employee also owes the company nothing, and should jump ship if they get a better offer from another company, or if they reach a point in their life where they would prefer to not work than work. Neither side is wrong to do what's in their own best interest, as long as it is within the law, and within the agreed upon parameters of their employment contract.  Expecting another party to feel obligations to you that go beyond what the contract says they are obligated to do for you is naive, and setting one's self up for disappointment. You can't have an economy built upon unrealistic expectations and ideals about how people in an economy behave. People are ultimately going to act in their own best interest, and you can't control them.
Yahweh didn't make a bet with the Devil or Lucifer (who are two different people, one of which doesn't appear in the Bible).  He made a bet with a divine Accuser (satan), whose role is to prosecute against the goodness of humanity (i.e. advocate how bad humanity is).  John 19's point was that it was criticizing the Jews that were ostracizing the Jewish Johannine Christians.
Move to somewhere that supports it or work to change how your state feels about it. The federal government is not a tool to be used to force your beliefs down other peoples throats.
You're incorrect in using the term Cognitive dissonance. That implies you understand two views are exclusive. You would be aiming for Doublethink as your word of choice.
Sanders just voted Aye to limit debate on the USA Freedom act - that is, to bring it closer to passing.
Funny because even federally funded elections wouldn't stop the problem with Citizens United, ie, what's stopping anybody from making an anti-Hillary documentary and putting it on Netflix?  I mean I look forward to seeing proposed legislation to "get money out of politics" but so far there is a loophole everywhere.
&gt; “Let’s say she wins by less than 20 percent,” said Mr. Meyer, chairman of the Tri-County Democrats. “That’s a two-ticket-out-of-Iowa thing.”  This is what the Sanders team is calling a victory, losing by 20 points.
yea i would definitely agree with this. Another reason why it is very difficult to condense the arguement for or against unions to sample size. In theory, Unions are a very good thing, and they were for a long time, but greed and corruption and power fracture the ideal. I wouldn't think abolishing unions completely is the answer, but the system is in definite need of an overhaul
Lol black people were farrrrr less equal than today, couldn't step on a whites shadow, would be hit with water from fire hoses, hell, they were segregated in ever form. Blacks have a lot more freedom today and are much more equal.
Everything is bullshit lies and illusion with the NeoCons...they are the true snake handlers of our day.
Again, I'm happy that he's fighting this. Because someone needs to. However, to pass blame instead of all the hours they have in Congress to make a bill that fixes this, to say that this is all Obama's fault (at the 4 minute mark to say it repeatedly), and now to have a motion passed a couple minutes ago to limit debate on provisions, JUST PASS SOMETHING TO FIX THIS. I'll be happy when this dies at midnight.
[deleted]
Sweet let's do Illinois next!
I'll see if I can find the article I read it in. Admittedly I may be misremembering the stat.
What could possibly go wrong.
No but I'm also not inside Sander head so I can't speak for his reasoning nor can you. But that doesn't mean you're wrong just that anything you say is speculation and shouldn't be stated as fact.
And his opposition will do nothing to stop it from being passed. Did you even read at what the Freedom Act is supposed to do, or did you automatically assume it was bad because of the name? (I did, until I read up on it.)
&gt; [W]e must remove religion from the political sphere. We must make it known that right wing demagoguery is not Christianity in action.  Shutting the barn door after the horse has already gotten out.  It is WAY too late to try to make this case now.  The association between Christianity and the right is deep and shored up by decades of politics, and Christians by-and-large let it happen.
I agree. It seems these days that conservatives and liberals are switching on some issues, ie. conservatives for free speech (albeit offensive) and liberals for censorship of some forms of media ie. Muhammed cartoons.
Wow you're a nearly perfect right wing caricature!  Big business policies with a less than subtle tinge of racism. Throw in some repression of voting rights, threats of violence and homophobia for good measure too.  And then is that a Nazi reference at the end?!? That really puts a bow on it.
Stealing from  the taxpayers, in order to get elected, says something totally different.  In fact, he could break all sorts of records 'caring' when it's not his money.
No. I never said they were infallible, and I never said they were the word***s*** of God. Jesus is the Word of God. This is how I know you don't know what you're talking about.  Do you think the words of the Odyssey were the literal words first uttered? No, of course not. Do you care? No. Why? Because the message being transmitted is pretty much untouched. Details may be slightly off or different, but the story itself isn't.
What could possiblie go wrong.
That is literally the worst idea I have ever heard.
And so did Warren.   Not only did neither Warren nor Sanders join in the bipartisan Paul/Wyden attempt to stop the Patriot Act, they literally both just effectively voted for it (I know what cloture is) . But I would bet everything that tomorrow there will be another thread on here about how Bernie is against the surveillance and Rand Paul is crazy. This is a joke. 
You have spotted what i call greed friend and maybe even a side of blackmail. We are all guilty though.
Dude he literally just voted to repass the Patriot Act instead of letting it expire. 
the kind that claims everyone thinks the same way as yourself.
That's fucked up.   I'm steering more towards Rand Paul
"General warrants are what we fought the revolution over."   Damn right Rand. WTF are the other senators right now? "Director of National Intelligence lied to congress", good for Rand pointing that out. 
It's someone trying to meet Ted Cruz at his level.
Someone's right to belong to a union starts where the right of others not to belong ends.
 Finals, firearms, "this is my first fuck but I'm never gonna love again"s and keggers. But don't spark up a doobie. That would be dangerous or something.
Same for the wireless companies. Games can use up a lot of your monthly data.
There's alot of back-scratching.    "My cousin applied for a job.  He's a good kid."  Hiring Guy knows this guy is important on police force, etc.  Checks to see if he needs to meet a quota on women or minorities, as this is more important.  Hires cousin if recommender has enough juice.  You could sue, but even if you won, what then?
Right, there is an infinite amount of money so vast swaths of everyone losing income won't effect the economy!
The article is talking about economic equality between workers and corporations, not between races and genders.
Call them, email them, write them letters, send pigeons. Make our voices heard.
I'm not making it up. Sanders is the dude who said it. 
While my left-leaning outlook wants to agree with this, I will add that *mandatory* union membership is bullshit, and should be outlawed. I work in an office environment (in state government no less) and I don't see the value the union garnishing a percentage of my wages. 
That graph just shows frequency of El Niño years, not severity.  Edit: Lol really? Downvotes for pointing out a fact? Look at the graph. Quit downvoting just because something even remotely challenges something people here favor.
Yea Unions should be more powerful. Great.  /s
Your problem is that  particular job is what most would call an, "unskilled trade." You can't expect to make very much in a job like that when anyone off the street can come in and learn it in a day.  Also, you are comparing a low skill job with that of a skilled store manager and union rep. The fact that an unskilled, uneducated person can make half of what the store manager or union representative does is amazing.
So...the entire New Testament is *not* scripture? Someone should inform the entirety of Christianity!
Your last sentence is exactly why most workers are anti union
&gt; What do you think will happen to Bernie's support written they get to choose from a "liberal" like O'Malley or someone a bit more genuine like Chafee?  It will double at least. Chafee? Genuine? Maybe in his own way.  &gt; Hillary is way more popular with democrats than people give her credit for.  She is popular among Democrats right now, yes. Way more popular than people think? The way things unfold will reveal whether that is true or not.
It's so funny how every time unions are mentioned on reddit a former union representative like /u/jamrev comes along and hysterically starts preaching for hours how evil unions are (he's been at it for 4 hours now). As a European it's so obvious what he's trying to do and after seeing [how far US corporations are willing to go to fight unions](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/20/1386283/-Walmart-s-leaked-anti-union-video-is-crazy) it doesn't surprise me.   Anyways, the sources he linked to are nonsense. The US is the least unionized country in the West. That's the main reason you have the weakest worker rights and the worst labor laws. Unions are a necessary evil for workers to negotiate their rights. Without them you are left at the mercy of employers and the US is a good example of what that leads to.   That's not to say that unions don't have their share of corruption and incompetence, but if that were a reason to get rid of an organization completely then you would also have to abolish the [NFL](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/the-corrupt-bargain-between-politicians-and-the-nfl/380701/), [NBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal), [MLB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_scandals), your government and every major corporation.   In Europe unions are just another part of the political process. When corruption occurs you punish the people involved and move on. [Here is a list of corruption scandals in the US government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_scandals_in_the_United_States). Sometimes nothing happens at all, sometimes the guilty party resigns. Hardly ever are there criminal charges. That's how politics works everywhere in the world and how unions handle corruption here.  It's not just through the absence of unions that you are getting shafted by the way. In Europe companies also have what's called a [works council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council) that consists of a group of elected employees who act as a labor representative within a company. You could see it as a miniature union for a single company. In most European countries and Canada and Japan they are mandatory for larger companies. While in the US they are illegal. That alone should tell you how backwards labor laws in the US are. But I'm sure /u/jamrev will be back soon to explain why it all makes sense. :D  
thanks for clarifying that to these knuckleheads
&gt; The wealthy also strike every few months, asking for lower taxes and lower wages for the employes or they will offshore a deparment.  I agree with the general premise of this statement (that the wealthy "strike" too), but I do not agree with the conflating of private wealth and corporate business practices.  They are two completely separate categories.  Asking the wealthy to pay a larger share of their income for taxes is a completely different question from corporate tax responsibility. 
Never watched the show and don't understand the correlation so we're all good.
This is what most americans see as a well, especially our out of control public sector unions. Popular articles on reddit dont reflect the majority. Unions become corrupt fast and then work to protect the worst workers, replace meritocracy with seniority, and make jobs a favor system with those who are connected.    They made sense in the days of early factory work, but nowadays they are ancient legacies that hurt modern economies.
I was a Meat cutter doing basically everything in the department my manager was doing, writing orders, setting up the department, doing inventory, doing meetings while doing all my regular jobs. My manager was the highest non corporate paid person in the store. And calling the managers of the store a skilled trade is laughable! The point being there was a time my "unskilled" butcher position used to be enough to provide for a family and buying a house. The union did nothing but took money from me and padded their own pockets with it.
Yes, because he is a crook like the rest except maybe even a little worse.
sorry at this point it's just a knee-jerk reaction because so many people I encounter here are rabid partisans
I'm confused on your point... I think people hate it because it's not based on quality of work so they end up seeing older members doing nothing and making more. That's bullshit.
Quick! Someone call him a commie! /s
It's not really under handed at all. I don't know much about this particular piece of legislation, but it seems like a pretty clever economic mechanism. It drives union membership, which is "good." It protects businesses that can't afford a $15/hr minimum wage providing their employees unionize, which is "good." It incentivizes employers to unionize, which is "good" (work place safety, work/life balance, continued raises to the minimum wage, etc.) All the while it protects all non-unionized workers and guarantees a $15 minimum wage.   Unions do a lot more then just look after how much you make. Legal representation, job security, workplace safety, etc. The only real legitimate criticism I feel is that by doing this they're driving their membership and therefore their revenue.   Perhaps unions should be public institutions that the tax payer funds.
Wrong. Context is very important. Jesus says, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel" to a Canaanite woman asking for him to heal her daughter. Literally four verses later... "Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment."
Bernie Sanders is the internet's new Ron Paul.
He technically caucuses with the Democrats. 
Random chance?
No, first you debate Hillary. Don't be a coward.
Yes, we get it. 
&gt;Why do you characterize my response using a vulgarity?  Because those are the words I feel most accurately describe it.  &gt;Perhaps a better question would have been, "In what union are you a member?"  Still hung up on the semantics.   &gt;"I might just rationally explain why the Union brings in that much money." The tone of your replies have been anything but rational  Dancing around it still.  &gt;You need to chill. Turn down the testosterone.  I don't need to do anything. You don't know my gender.  &gt;You may think this is a bargain.  I don't know if it is a bargain. That would depend on what you get in exchange for them. I assume it's a bargain because of your reluctance to actually say which union it is.  &gt;I just don't like having to pay to keep it.  Unless your group unionized after you were hired (unlikely in this era) you chose to join when you took your job which means you chose to pay to get the job.  
haha I get it. No party is perfect but republicans are batshit crazy compared to the other side.
Well, yes. The processes that drive evolution is the same whether it is long term or short term; genetic drift, mutations, etc. with natural selection as the driving force. And it makes sense to theorize (in a layman sense) that this means animals evolve, which many Christians do believe. However, to say that this concludes that we came from a single common ancestor and evolved is a bit more of an estimated guess. As a theory, can we not say that a Creator made animals that can evolve? Though, as I've pointed out, the common ancestor is a more believable theory than having a God because the current level of research points towards it.  We observe that humans and chimps share 99% of our DNA. But if I may, why is it so hard to believe a Creator (let's assume, just for this discussion that he exists) to create living organisms, when observed have similar building structures?   To point out the gift of rational thought can be very subjective. Logic, in general, flows from one thought to another connecting thought. On this point, I believe what a person sees as rational can be irrational to another because you need a starting point to start connecting your thoughts. I noticed most Christians already believe that God exists, and is part of their base logic, something they accept "on faith." Another example would be those who believe in the age of the world using carbon dating. They accept "on faith" that carbon dating provides a somewhat accurate measurement and that the process of radioactive decay is predictable for millions of years.  I would point out that science is not rejected by most Christians. It's just another way of observing the world. However, what is questioned are some of the current conclusions drawn from the growing research.  Also, just a disclaimer, I'm not trying to change your (or Reddit's) point of view. I just see so much bandwagon hate about those who believe in Creationism.
That is great news. Good job
They'll never agree, as he would slam all of them for their corruption and greed.  No way any of them look good on the other side of that. 
lol, yeah. Ill give him one thing.  At least he's honest enough to admit he's a full fledged, card carrying socialist. He will never get elected.  Not going to happen.   
&gt; What does ISIS or AQAP care?  Their recruit pools would diminish 
This would be a debate only between democratic candidates 
So I guess the ultimate theme is "Fuck fast food chains, nobody should work there, it's not a real job."  Remind me again then why these jobs are counted for labor statistics?  There's a real logical disconnect somewhere here...
So your plan is to have people work like 25 years and then be retired for 40? How exactly are we going to afford having people collecting retirement longer than they actually worked? 
Don't build in loopholes

Very tough to reform unions without right to work laws. The fact that they die without government granting them monopoly power is an intrinsic flaw.
...but Condoleeza Rice said it was very vague...something like "bin Laden determined to attack" or something...totally vague.  
This is the same "brave and refreshing" position taken by every candidate ever who is not the front-runner in their race.
Fuck Reagan with a fucking baseball bat.
You should really read up on socialism/anything.  Socialism is not a political system, so your comment "that would under monarchism" makes absolutely no sense (apart from the obvious grammatical error).  In fact, all 3 of your "rebuttals" make no sense.  
&gt; We were a bigger country than them when we passed Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Welfare, etc.  Well then, what's the problem? We have Medicare! Medicaid! Social Security! Welfare!  We have all those things so we surely don't compare unfavorably to all those Scandinavian countries, right?

Something in the middle, yeah that makes more sense to me. Thanks. I think you will find a lot of people will misunderstand the use of the word capitalism and socialism, even when underneath they agree on the substance of the problems and solutions.

Totally manufactured event... Ignorant, self-righteous (and self-promoting) provokers get attacked. They got what they were asking for. (I'm certainly not condoning the actions of either side.)  This event pretty much marks a turning point. And an unfortunate one.  Trying to untangle this rat's nest with any calm-minded clarity or objectivity in the public realm is pretty much now impossible. We allowed small-minded Christian fundamentalists / republican xenophobes to take control of "our" collective side of the discourse. Guess they just weren't satisfied with "fighting them over there".

It also says Obama embellished some of the original talking points given to him by the CIA.  And the article mentions how american intelligence failed miserably with middle east policies, and how intelligence assumed Arab Spring would undermine Al Qaeda (arguably the Arab spring stopped short in Syria and Iraq, and many impoverished and ex baathists found ISIS to be appealing, so it did undermine Al Qaeda..).  We all know Benghazi was a CIA station, it would be nice if we had someone just come out and say what we were doing there instead of this political back and forth.  We need CURRENT employees to leak info, not ex employees getting book deals.
The 270 required votes is the fptp element that will be removed. The two (and frequently three) coalition parties would still be roughly half of the government facing an opposition. That's vastly different from two parties being each other's opposition.

There's always a chance that a Democrat will win the popular vote but lose the electoral college vote like in 2000. If that happens again, it would (hopefully) cause enough of a controversy to push election reform.

As someone from New Hampshire, I can tell you that Hillary Clinton will win this state's primary pretty easily. We went for her in 2008 over Obama. In that same primary, Kucinich (who was another very liberal candidate, not unlike Sanders) only got 1% of the vote...
You're joking, right?
People don't just murder people because they feel like it. Poverty, lack of educational resources, lack of opportunity, a new found focus on how systematic that lack of opportunity is, poverty, criminalization of a plant that's less dangerous than alcohol, and an oppressive police force all collide to create the cluster-fuck we just witnessed.

Meh. Libertarians are confused. A Libertarian is a person who hasn't seen the world for what it is. Anybody who thinks that a 'free market' is possible is delusional, or just misinformed.    Also, we need strong government agencies to reel in the abuses of big business. We need organizations like OSHA and the EPA.

He is just naive, he's never been hurt by this nasty world. 
That's an insult to Oompah Loompah's.  At least they *work*
No.  I don't agree with that.  I believe in a Fair Tax (**NOT** a Flat Tax).  Those making less than ~$34,000 per year are given prebates to offset taxes for that year.  Taxes are collected from services, goods, etc., and there is no longer any income tax.  Those who are wealthier, purchase more and therefore pay more taxes.  Those who are poorer, pay little to no taxes.  The only part I agree with is ensuring that everyone pays - corporations included.  There should be no deductions for anyone.  Your rate is your rate and you pay what you pay - and there's no way to reduce your effective tax rate.
That's going to be a fun excerpt in the future for history textbooks about global warming.
Taxes would be lower...
Man, Bernie Sanders can talk, almost as much as Ron Paul. No wonder he has been as productive in Congress.
Serious question.  I fully oppose the GOP and think they're complicit in destroying the planet for temporary profits.  But the one argument they have against climate change I'm still not sure of a counter argument to.  They say the Earth hasn't warmed in 18 years (despite 2010(?) and 2014 being the warmest on record).  What is the counter argument to this?
With oil at $50 per barrel, it's not $45 billion.
Not researching and understanding is even better!  Ignorant bible thumper's at work here? Your kids are gonna be so grateful for the policies these fucks set out.  Maybe in a few years all 'US politicians' from this era will be marked as criminals.  The whole world and the US is better of if the current 'house committee'  is executed immediately. This has never been tried before in the US, see how this works out in restoring democracy.
They understand ROI, they're investing in a religious theonomy, religious based government. 
Well, to be fair,  a vote for Hillary is basically a vote for the same interests as a vote for the GOP. Both are owned by investment groups and the mega rich, so yeah, both parties are kinda the same, and while the dems may have a few good eggs (like Bernie or Elizabeth) there are many more totally corrupt dems like hilly that run the show. It hurts the fuck out of he party too, because mid ground people like my self don't want to vote for Hillary and Feinstein types just as much as we don't want Ted Cruz types. 
Remember, if you can't see it, it's not there.  So if you're about to be attacked by a tiger, just close your eyes. It'll be all right.

I have heard them (*cough* Rush Limbaugh *cough* Sean Hannity *cough*) claim higher CO2 levels will increase crop yields and increase greenery, so that's why factories and automobiles dumping CO2 into the air is oh so great. /s&amp;dagger;  Now, inside a greenhouse increased CO2 does improve yield, which is what some greenhouses do--pump in additional CO2; however, on a global scale the negative impacts far outweigh plants getting more CO2 such as increased thunderstorms, more wildfires, less rainfall, rising sea levels, diminishing aquatic life, algae blooms, runaway temperatures, dwindling surface water, etc, which all would significantly harm the ecosystem.   &amp;dagger;/s for the sarcasm challenged.

Every attempt at Communism has failed, and it failed in terrible, terrible ways at a heinous cost to its citizenry.   Here's the thing: A concept by itself, is worthless. It has to have a functional working model to be of value. There has never been, in human history, a truly functional and successful Communist State.   It was given a chance, and it failed every time. 
It's extra problematic when you realize there are many folks that realize it's real, but refuse to do any solution that results in any redistribution of wealth.
Why?  Because prisons are a profit center.   Mental health facility are cost centers.  The state *makes* money by jailing people, and spends it keeping them healthy. Go figure they'd rather jail someone. Explains a lot of the laws currently in place, too.
I welcome the extinction of the human race with open arms.  Bring on the apocalypse.
But there ARE successful Capitalist States. The has never been a successful Communist State. Even China has had to all but abandon it.  When the are no successful attempts at something in history, that is referred to as a failure. It doesn't mean that you can't learn from it, but it does make it a failure. 
New Hampshire Democrats tend to be more conservative or moderate... Just because there are some people on the fringe that support Sanders doesn't mean he has a huge backing here. What I said isn't not true just because it's not what you want to hear or believe.

You are right, the Deskjets 500 and 510C were the first good consumer level printers about and I had a few HPs back in the early 90s-2000s but then the software became bloated and the paper tray was a PITA.  And of course printers in general are the most troublesome peripheral going.
They control all the news and internet communications, the largest most obvious example, petending GWBush was elected.  He was not, not the first election and not the second election and this 2014 election was just warm up for taking over the Presidency and the Congress in 2016, the information control is now so tight it doesn't matter what they do at the precinct level.   All they have to do is start screaming about illegals voting and away we all go down the drain, never mind they never present any evidence of this mass illegal immigrant voting. 
So because one Democrat lies, the GOP should be able to never tell the truth.   That's pretty fucked up

I thought the New Deal got the US out of the Great Depression and (along with WWII) kicked off several decades of growth and a vastly expanded middle class. Capitalism can be a positive force when balanced with sane social policies and reasonable regulation. I'm not aware of any great success stories that rely solely on one or the other.

Conservatives embrace ignorance.
&gt;they like to hoard it or invest it in stocks and hedge funds.  Investments such as these are taxed, you know that right?  Of course you do.  Also, what I'm proposing is more fair than the system we have now.  It provides for those who make less than ~$34,000 and ensures there are not loopholes to taxation.  There is no ability for a company to reduce their effective tax rate through some loophole.  Further, it does not punitively tax the rich or middle class.  And the tax would not be as exorbitant as you suggest.  Further, the means of collection at PoS is already in place in a majority of states so there would be a relatively minimal infrastructure expenditure at the outset.
To be fair, what is considered democracy in the USA has pretty much failed us.

I may get downvoted, but what the hell... I disagree with their environmental policies; but I support the Republicans most of the time. The sad thing is that I agree with most of what the Democrats are fighting for (Healthcare reform, Gay Rights, etc.) except for one topic, gun laws. I know that there are many Democrats that believe that the 2nd Amendment is unequivocal like I do, but when the party as a platform issue believes that I should be deprived of my right of self defense (a right I have already used to defend my life) so that they may feel "safe", I must vote for the other party that respects that right (for the most part). Call me a coward/crackpot/lunatic, but I carry a firearm with me every day, hoping that it is never needed again. I am a single issue voter, and until the Democratic Party gets it head out of its ass and looks at firearms in a rational matter; they will never have my vote.

It's so infuriating listening to my friends whom I know to be liberal advocating for Clinton. It's like they've never even thought about *why* the GOP is so corrupt, so never even thought about the problem of money in politics. It's as if everyone is already in agreement that they want another Bush, so as long as we put Bush 1 and Bush 2 in the race everyone is wins! Yay for Citigroup!
It was drafted because the articles of confederation (the governing document in use between the revolution and the constitution) made for a central government barely capable of maintaining order when a few hundred yokels rose up due to a liquor tax.

I'm totally biased against the Republican party and social conservatives, so much of what I will say will be ignored.  That said, we need the **opposite** of what conservatives are peddling these days.  More taxes on corporations (especially large ones) and higher income taxes on the wealthy.  We should use that money, in part, for more scientific research and development to fix the issues related to runaway climate change.
Exactly. There are other organizations that can study earth sciences.
These guys are in elite company, Not everyone gets to be a traitor to an entire planet.
I know some very rational people who hold what I consider irrational beliefs, like climate change denying, and it mostly boils down to trust.  It's the same reason you can never convince a conspiracy theorist that they're in the wrong.  Once you accept that there is some sort of conspiracy going on, all evidence that contradicts your belief system is suspect to being "fabricated as part of the conspiracy".  The biggest problem isn't that Conservative leaders are arguing that climate change doesn't exist, the problem is they're arguing that *you cannot trust scientists*.  This automatically makes any evidence presented by the opposite side invalid.  It's a steep hill to hike up, sadly.
This is the conservative adult version of sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting "la, la, la la, I can't hear you!"

Good analogy, but you completely missed the point.

Also, there's the whole thing with state-sponsored telecom monopolies, and I'm sure plenty of other examples of harmful government intervention in markets.

It's was sold as an exponential curve that has since been found to be a sigmoid curve.  It's not cherry picking and it's not short term.  The pause has been going on longer then modern climate research(aka the satellite record) despite an emission scenario worse then the worst that the IPCC projected (RPC 8.5)  Some scientists are predicting 7-15 more years of a pause or even cooling thanks to the fact that the AMO(Atlantic multidecadal oscillation) is turning negative and the solar cycle is headed back to it's minimum from its current peak.  http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28870988  &gt;The hiatus in the rise in global temperatures could last for another 10 years, according to new research.  &gt;Scientists have struggled to explain the so-called pause that began in 1999, despite ever increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.  &gt;The latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30-year cycle in the Atlantic Ocean is behind the slowdown.

I'm a moderate liberal but wow is the far-left circle jerk going nuts in here. With that being said, would vote for Sanders 100 out of 100 times before voting Hillary.
Keep going at it, Republicans. Maybe we in Europe or Asia will now attract the best of minds with our increased funding for scientific research of all sorts. Do you know how many people the Max Planck Society has already poached from top Ivy League places in the last decade? Keep at it. 
Socialism isn't only about economics. It's a way to make a stable society.
Let's be clear: corporations are made up of people. So there are two ways to approach governance of them; you can govern in a way that provides a benefit to the people as a whole and therefor corporations are included, or you can legislate in a way that provides benefits to corporations at the *expense* of the people.   Which do you think the TPP falls under?
Yeah, in economic terms, conservative means smoothing out the bumps and keeping things running efficiently, protecting workers from exploitation, and protecting businesses from each other and themselves. It's about having a stable and agreeable status quo to avoid the risk of social upheaval.  But try telling the people here on /r/politics that they're conservative in any way whatsoever, and their heads will explode.
   Pathetic.
&gt;there's a chance that someone might not have to work as hard as me... but still be able to live as comfortably as me.  It's funny because that's what we deal with now where those in very rich families can live off of investments and be in a lower effective tax bracket than someone who works 60+ hours each week.  People are still sold on the lottery dream where they think that one day they may be in the 1%, so they vote as if they are.  
How any of these self-proclaimed "conservatives but not wack job" can still justify voting Republican is beyond me.
american rightwing politics are developing more and more into "anti science cults". sad...
You are exactly right.  I'm a flaming liberal, and bitch probably as much about Democrats as Republicans.  But I still hold my nose and vote for them on election day.  It's still the most powerful thing you can do as a "regular" citizen.  The ONLY way you can change the system is to vote.  And the biggest way to change your party, of course, is through primaries.  This is why Bernie Sanders' presidential attempt is critical for the future of the Democratic Party, I think.  If they don't treat Bernie fairly in this, they are going to disengage a lot of people.

If poverty can be blamed on welfare abuse why are public welfare queens like Paul Ryan so fucking rich?
As a Republican, and a man, her vagina really is the most appealing thing. I want to like her and I want our party to be the first with a woman president, but she just has way too much baggage.   I'm afraid Hillary is going to get elected just because she is a woman. And people aren't taking these conflicts of interest with her charity donors seriously... she really could be one of the most corrupt presidents in recent history. Even though he's more liberal, I would almost prefer Bernie Sanders because at least he's honest and I think he'd govern with good intentions. 
&gt;Not that you can tell by graduation rates.   Thats not because they gutted revenue through trickle down nonsense.
Both are very similar in how they are a threat to their establishment party members. Very different politics however. My point is that it isn't unreasonable to support one anti establishment guy and then another who might have completely opposite viewpoints (this isn't the case, Paul and Sanders have a lot of issues in common).   Right now it is the people vs. the establishment that is the worthy fight. Who cares what color that establishment is?

Actually NASA and the DoD work jointly on many projects and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the DoD to start up a project and fund NASA to perform the work. If the President made that arrangement public in the correct context, it could be taken very positively as the military would be seen as participating in scientific endeavors in the public interest. Of course, the GOP would work to find a way to twist it, but the general public would probably be supportive.
&gt; not a Hillary supporter  I don't think so, I think we had a conversation just yesterday about the Foundation, about the same thing.  &gt;attack on the foundation is ridiculous  People don't necessarily attack the "Foundation" for that single issue:  [Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation as Russians Pressed for Control of Uranium Company](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0)  ["Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars in donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei — all of which the State Department has faulted over their records on sex discrimination and other human-rights issues."](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-faces-test-of-record-aiding-women.html)  [Clinton foundation received up to $81m from clients of controversial HSBC bank](http://www.theguardian.com)   Now, I suggest you to take some time and read them, before calling them lies or fabrications like all Hillary "supporters", this are reputable sources.  And don't even get me started on the multiple times the Clinton Foundation has failed to deliver quality help to the  poor, Haiti anyone?:  [Clinton Foundation HQ Protested For ‘Missing Money’ In Haiti Recovery](http://freebeacon.com/issues/clinton-foundation-hq-protested-for-missing-money-in-haiti-recovery/)  The fact the you are trusting the of word of Bill Clinton tells me that you really are not informed of the situation, Bill Clinton is not a reputable person as he have been proven to be a ~~pathological~~ liar.
It shouldn't be trench warfare, It should be a compromise. The whole problem with US politics today is many people act more like children than adults. They want it ALL, NO COMPROMISES. I just don't understand it.
But why should that have to happen?  Why would the DoD be targeted for the shifting of funds?  There are plenty of other agencies that could take the same type of budget cut to fund more climate change studies.
Bill Gates...you're ok with Bill Gates going nuclear...
Hillary is going to get elected because she's a smart political veteran who's positioned herself for this run for decades.  And since when did taking money become a bad thing?    Republicans have been screeching that Citizens United is awesome, but when the same thing happens with the Clinton Foundation, she's horrible all of a sudden?  Gonna be pretty hard to pull that little hypocritical gymnastic stunt off this election cycle.
Sadly, most Americans don't actually know the difference between socialism and communism.
I consider myself a "true conservative" as you put it. Yes. It is.   To a true conservative, a multi-national corporation is, well, a fucking nightmare too.  Should Walmart pay a better wage? Yes. Should the government step in and play the same role to Walmart as Walmart has been to it's employees (namely asserting and dictating what they are or are not allowed to do, or what they can and cannot have)? Would that be a step forward? Probably not.   Why does everyone have such faith in a federal oligarchy?  People help people. Not governments. Not corporations. People. Sometimes a bunch of good people get together and make a great organization, or effect government positively...but it's always people who do the helping, and to whom we need to look to for making a better tomorrow.  As an aside, if you assert what you want on a weaker person or entity (and punish them if they resist) you are a tyrant. Period. It doesn't matter if you are a group of well-meaning religious fundies, or a bunch well-meaning LGBT equal-rights activists. It doesn't matter if you are a small business with 5 employees or a Walmart. It doesn't matter if you are the small-town sheriff or the POTUS. It doesn't even matter if you are a bunch of anonymous redditors. Asserting that it's your way or the highway, or demonizing an opponent through *ad hominem* attacks is the opposite of upholding a free society. Being told it's some one else's way or the highway, and being attacked simply for maintaining a disagreeing position is the very definition of a loss of liberty. edit: it doesn't even matter if you are right or wrong.
Super surprised they didn't include him being a creationist.
I didn't say anything about any of that.    The only person I called a liar was Rush Limbaugh because his statement was a lie.    I don't support Hillary, I will support Sanders as long as it's an option then I'll view Hillary is a poor second choice.    The fact remains that the money isn't being wasted on "staff" the way much of the criticism suggests.

Why is the national aeronautics and space administration studying climate change on Earth?
An african american seventh day adventist with no political experience who wants to regulate semis and get rid of insurance companies?  Not gonna happen, nobody in the party will support it.
I'm not advocating money in politics, but don't you see the difference in taking money from Americans and American business and taking money directly from foreign governments?  You think Saudi princes are donating to the Clintons because it's for a good cause? 
Then get the military to take up the research.  They're used to looking at satellite data, transition the necessary scientists from NASA and make it a joint mission.  Climate Change is going to be the military's problem soon enough anyway with mass migrations and natural disasters tearing up populated areas..  Spin goes both ways, play it out as a military project.
You are delusional if you think that those contributions are made up in any meaningful way by regular working class citizens.  They are "individuals" with a major financially vested interest in her winning.  Individuals would contribute without linking their contribution to the company that hires them.  You don't seem to understand how contributions work.  My employer wouldn't be listed if I contributed.  My name would.
Not if your white, you mitwit.
So, please, tell us who you support, so I can then dissect it and tell you why you're an idiot. 
Terrible idea, I would spin it in the media as them pulling X$ away from national security funding. Never mention what it was for, just that they took the money away to spend on pork projects in their home districts and it makes you Joe Blow more likely to die horribly. The democratic party has major issues using the media as the blunt force weapon it has become.
So why doesn't reddit and all the other people opposed to this come together and raise donations to fund it themselves?
Hell, even if you're white.  White people don't get incarcerated at the same rates as black people, but they still get it more than people in pretty much any other country.  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/04/daily-chart-16
That doesn't mean everything under the sun involving anyone in the government should automatically be public. 
So, I'm no "denier", but using some logic, can you explain to me why you think this is such a bad thing?  Do you personally know what a slightly warmer climate will look like? Do you think that farmers felt the same way during the last ice age?   People on both sides need to take a deep breath.  Conservative side - it's okay to take care of our planet. We like clean air and a healthy ecosystem.  Global Warming folks - change is not the end of the world. People, and the planet adapt. The planet has been doing this for a few billion years.   You're letting your politics polarize you. You don't have to agree with everyone on everything, and moving further from the middle doesn't help your argument.  Edit: I see some cry-baby has gone on a downvoting tirade through all of my comments. Good work, buddy. Way to show your true colors rather than just joining a reasonable and logical discussion.
Obama is to the left of Third Way Politics, but just a little left..
I'm about as far from American conservative as you can get. I think America Works could be useful with a limited scope but is fundamentally misguided. [Here is why.](http://np.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/32sjk2/the_risks_of_employer_of_last_resort/) I'd love to hear what you think because that idea on a popular tv show scares me.
You're right, there are a lot of self centered morons out there that this country is #1 at everything and taking cues from other countries is terrible.  Fuck those delusional people.
To be honest, the local level (state/city) is the best place to see these increases in minimum wage take place (for now).  For all the discussion about minimum wage, there's is almost data to study the effects of anything other than a small change. Results seem to show that a slight increase has little to no effect on overall employment rates - but we just don't know what happens with the 50-100% increases some of these groups are pushing for. Whatever your current stance on minimum wage, seeing these changes at the local level is a great thing, since studying the data should help up make a better decision. If the data looks good, then I'm hopeful support will grow to make the change at the federal level as well.
how juvenile . . .
&gt;If you raise the tax on all goods and services by the same amount wouldn't it effect poor people more than rich people?  The prebate could be adjusted to keep in line with inflation or increase in taxes.  Also an adjustment could be made to the income threshold.  So no.  It wouldn't.  &gt;How are you going to theoretically raise taxes if you decide to you need to bring in more money?  The point is that to avoid the cycle of attempting to raise/lower taxes on a frequent basis.  Rather, build a stable and consistent tax base whereby you can **accurately** project your revenue years ahead and plan your budgets accordingly.  Consumption of goods and services, by and large, increase - sure there are downturns (housing crash, .com crash, etc.) but on average they increase.  &gt;Why is it more fair to tax people for buying things than it is to tax people's income?  I think it's fair because you're taxing people based upon what they use and how much they use.  I think that there will always exist rich and poor - by simple chance or by choice.  And therefore I do not think it right to judge or punish people based upon their income.  Jealousy and greed are not the sole domain of the rich - and they are unbecoming characteristics of anyone who possesses them.
&gt;"I'll just turn up the AC if the planet warms up." These are actual sentiments of real people.  These are the sentiments of a true circle-jerk.
Wow.
Curious how he plays to the Reddit crowd here.  I personally really like him as a person. He's a tremendous speaker, and I truly feel his heart is in the right place and he desperately wants to make this country better than what it already is.    I do however think most of his positions on social issues make him a non-starter in a general election.  But he's got a great American dream story. And I appreciate his primary message of small government and personal responsibility.  Maybe a future HHS?
Exactly.  Although the DoD has it's own corruption and bad decision making (like mothballing the A10 ground support aircraft in favor of inferior "multi-role" solutions).
If there is a Bible in the house and you go to church on Sunday there is no reason to go to school.
&gt;But jumping on your opponents for a fault that your own people demonstrate with just as much rigor is unadulterated hypocrisy.  No it isn't. There's a strict division of labor here. If a Democrat lies, that's /r/conservative's job to point out, not ours. They have their area of expertise, and this place has theirs. I take it you don't go over there and point out the same hypocrisy. That's right, you'd get banned if you did that.
That's what you get when you have a climate change denialist running the http://science.house.gov/  * Subcommittee on Environment: Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), Chairman - Climate Change Denier * Subcommittee on Energy: Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas), Chairman - Climate Change Denier
This article and my point aren't about abolishing a federal minimum wage. The article argues that the federal minimum wage needs to be higher than now. I'm saying it's fine where it is. 
Great, who launched them
The same electorate that put the GOP in the House and Senate. Or the one that showed up for Obamas elections and sat the rest out?
That's why NASA needs more money for exploration and space, not doing shit other agencies, like NOAA, should be doing. Studying the ocean and the atmosphere is in their fucking name.

Job creators.
See, this is a proper way to spin it.  It's a budget cut.  NASA isn't getting the money, but instead they are partnering with the military to provide the same study - only using the DoD budget. 
It's kind of odd that the schools would start closing early due to budget cuts that haven't started. I'm not sure I believe the claims that these two things are related. I'm not sure I don't believe them either...
[deleted]
I don't care whether the allegations are valid or not. The whole idea that a prosecutor could send in the police to raid someone's house in full view of their friends and neighbors, and then prevent them from defending themselves or talking to counsel, is outrageous. Even if the charges are true, that still seems like prosecutorial abuse, and ripe for even more abuse. 
The sad part is he's strictly Mormon so he doesn't consume intoxicants.  What you're seeing is pure, sober Mitt!
That would be a terrible idea. Kind of like how, if you've ever negotiated for a new job and salary, you don't give out your current wage first as it puts you at a disadvantage.  Also many things the government does needs to be kept secret, not all problems in the USG will suddenly go away if everything is open to public scrutiny, it would make things worse.
You hunger for change, which, while quixotic, is hardly unattainable. You're not voting, so what are you doing to affect the political process? Naysaying is only the beginning, what is the counteraction? This site is brimming with apathetic contrarians, but that's a useless state to be in. I encourage you to do something, don't just fold your arms &amp; grimace. I'd love to see socialism cease to be a dirty word in the US, maybe start there.
We should believe them now, because they are never wrong...expect when they were completely wrong 3 decades ago. Got it.  I love the "deniers" label btw, you guys sound like a radicalized religion ranting about heretics and unbelievers whenever you drop that line.   EDIT: May 4th **2007**: "[We have only 8 years to avoid the worst affects of global warming!] (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/05/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment)"  &gt;But there could be as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global average rise of 2C or more.  OH NO! They are never wrong though, never.
It's not that odd, if you believe the savings this year will prevent a bigger net shortfall next year.  Better to shave one week off two years than two weeks off one year.
As well they should be.
for real, why dont they just cut a couple billion from the defense budget instead
I'm pretty sure it's an infomercial for police accountability.
Yeah we definitely shouldn't ignore the way the Democrats have handled scientific funding, but the problem in this example is the denial of climate science, specifically
&gt; Also, how many Bernie Sanders posts do you have to scroll to to get to this?   Seriously. I have to wade through an ocean of erect progressive penises for every new news story on Sanders just to get to something else. 
No, I'm sure they'll just pay to give the Pentagon weather satellites instead. 
Well, STOP FUCKING WHINING AND GET OUR TURNOUT I ELECTIONS TOO ATLEAST 85%!!!!! 59% in presidential and 36% in congress???  "America, the greatest democracy" WHAT A FUCKING JOKE!!!  I would be ashamed of myself if I were american, you all are responsible!!!!!!  SHAME ON YOU 👊
&gt; Also why doesn't Europe research this stuff?  Where on that article does it say that the European countries do not research that "stuff"?  We do have our own programmes and in general European countries do take climate change seriously.  
Interesting. Did Vancouver massively cut the social safety net while giving Elysium tax breaks? Is it likely that they would relocate Duck Dynasty absent tax incentives?
Texas never disappoints 
Riiiiiiight, but climate change skepticism is just a conspiracy... 
That's John Boehner
Actually, this budget proposal increases funding for NASA's actual mission, space flight and space exploration.
&gt; As long as those who are all about climate change factor in or at least understand that the sun itself has become warmer  What makes you think climate scientists wouldn't have already factored this in if it were true? The output of the sun has been continuously measured for decades. Obviously any changes would be factored into any climate model. The truth is that the sun's output is very slightly less than in the past.  As for the eventual death of the sun, that's billions of years in the future.
I am never thankful for Breitbart. Sorry.
While the two easily go together, our population was much smaller when cities like Pittsburgh were covered with coal clouds. Using cleaner resources is very important and effective, even with large populations. We need the type of data that will no longer be provided in order to make smart decisions. 
No way! Hilary will fix it all because blah blah woman president!
Who suggesting people shouldn't vote?  If you can't back up your opinion with evidence?  Why should I trust what you say vs. someone else?
I'm prepared for the down votes by the brigade of narrow minded downies on this subreddit, but honestly...  Fuck everyone in this sub who is bashing on Ben Carson saying he is ignorant, just another right wing nut job or how his "world views and opinions" are totally different.   The man is running for president, he has a long way to go and I wish him all the best.   It takes balls to run for president without **any** political experience and it's a breath of fresh air to see someone who hasn't spent a career playing the whole politics game. He offers a chance to bring an outside perspective on the issues affecting our country today.   Lots of people here on this sub are just as ignorant as he is when it comes to anything political. You're just as willing to be spoon fed crap by the media and companies like CNN and God forbid MSNBC.   Give the man a chance to run and actually see how the field plays out before writing him off into oblivion as a clown or a classless religious bible beating drum act.   And if you don't like it...remember that there was probably a teacher, coach, or maybe even your parents who thought you were a complete and total idiot at some point in your life and you have probably (hopefully?) have proved them wrong.   TL;DR: give the man a fucking chance like your miserable self was given at least once in your life.   Bring the downvotes. 
What specifically do you want proven again? Because that's another problem I have, you have not been specific on which part of what I said needs to be proven with mathematics and numbers. I said quite a few things there.
Nonsense.   Extreme secrecy is practically the only thing keeping this trade pact alive.   If everyone understood what was in this trade pact, implications for any American who isn't a bankster or senior exec at big corporations, etc, we'd have mobs on the streets with torches, pitchforks, and guillotines.  Does anyone really think ObamaCo is being secretive with this thing because they're trying to undermine Congressional support for it?
Absolutely, so called "right to work" does nothing but destroy workers rights to organize. And that's just another step toward taking slavery nationwide one state at a time. 
So 8 of the 293 school districts in Kansas are starting summer break a few days early.  And funding for schools was increased according to the article.  Article seems a little over the top trying to imply this is a systemic problem and not an issue with a few poorly managed school districts.
give a dog a biscuit and he's yours. sick of money in every aspect of government 
&gt; And none of them have anything to do with how the Foundation hires staff to do work directly instead of handing out grants.   Because you entirely missed the point here. He said:  &gt;attack on the foundation is ridiculous  And I responded with evidence of the Foundation wrongdoing (attention here).
Really? They spend billions of dollars for a few little things? I know for sure they would spend billions to convince young people that both parties are the same and that they shouldnt bother voting.
Smacked in the face with facts from climate scientists and you still won't see any backing down of the climate change zealots demanding sweeping change and tax hikes to combat a straw man of literally global proportions.
Among many other things, Carly Fiorina was a horrible CEO, tore HP down, and even former and current board members of HP have already spoken publicly saying they wouldn't vote for her because she was selfish and caused significant damage to the company.

China is currently making strides towards a less carbon dependent nation.
I'm a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer. This is just an empirical look at the opinions of the other STEM colleagues around me at Universities and in corporations.   1) There is not a consensus on the viewpoint on climate change among us. Not on what causes it nor on its cyclical nature.   2) There are pros and cons into spending money on researching it.  Con:  Economical: Provides relatively no economic benefit Pro: In case it is not cyclical and is human caused we MIGHT be able to mitigate it.  Con: If you are a religious believer, one might believe that spending will prove to be all for nothing if the consequences are very very long term, and you might be "ruptured"  out before then.  Pro: Weight learn that it is not human caused and thereby help reduce sanctions against corporations on CO2 emissions.   3) (I put this on twice because of its importance.) When putting the National debt into consideration. Knowing that what you're putting your money into  will result in a return seems a lot more economical than putting your money into something that even if understood will not result in a payout. (i.e. Why not let a rich, "in the black" country do it)   4) Those STEM colleagues that you do see that prescribe to the belief of human caused climate change are often the loudest. Squeaky wheel gets the grease right. Global destruction is a lot louder of a statement than "We are alright". No one really makes the news that says the world is fine, we will be here tomorrow. But if you're screaming we gotta save the planet or we will die. Then somebody will listen even if the consequences are a long time coming.   (Sorry,  this wasn't well written. I'm on my phone.  This wasn't meant to anger anyone,  I am just letting people know that the scientific community has split opinions)

This is the kind of shit that proves Democrats are no better than Republicans.  And I say that as someone who usually votes for the Democratic party.  Dems wonder why they can't get people to turn out...well it's because they sell us out just as bad as Republicans.  At least Republicans are honest about wanting to help their rich friends.  I hope Democrats wisen up and kill this thing.
The free market makes a good breeding ground for new ideas. The thing is, though, once an idea has really taken off it needs to be reeled in and controlled to keep it from getting out of hand and causing imbalance in the whole ecosystem.

Sometimes I think it would be great to have a far right president so they would totally shit on the country and people would finally see. But then I look at Kansas and know it's not worth it to prove a point.
That's why she wants a government job where they don't fire you for incompetency.
How much of NASAs budget has actually went forward successful evironment change ?    Whoops, too much logic. Let the circle jerk commence!
&gt;The Personal Income Tax Rate in Sweden stands at 56.90 percent. Personal Income Tax Rate in Sweden averaged 56.24 percent from 1995 until 2014, reaching an all time high of 61.40 percent in 1996 and a record low of 51.50 percent in 2000  &gt;If the individual belongs to a Finnish church, church tax of approximately 1 percent to 2 percent may also be due. The top marginal individual income tax rate for 2015 is 52.35 percent in Helsinki. The top marginal individual income tax rate for 2015 is 56.35 percent
I love this logic. Mitt Romney was a successful businessman? Running a country is totally different, and good business men make bad presidents! Just look at Harry Truman, he was a great president and an awful businessman! Carly Fiorina didn't do well as CEO? Clearly a disqualifier for becoming President of the United States.

You talk about me just wanting my turn to talk, but all you can do is call people ungrateful and smug and assholes as if you're actually helping in some way.   You ask for 20% cuts across with board when a cut to an organization like NASA's budget would have no appreciable affect.   You started off this conversation being offended. When all anyone needs to do to not be offended is listen to people who have spent their lives studying this.   The climate change "debate"  wouldn't even exist if scientists weren't trying to educate the public.  You haven't given some perfect solution, all you done is repeated what so many others have said.   Cut the budget! Democrats/Liberals/Educated people are snobby!   You think that's new?   If you want to actually do something new how about not being an angry jerk on the internet. 
WaPo - always on the cutting edge....
No you're right let's all be moderates, every side has a valid point and let the fascists take this country.
Ahhh.. The old and absolutely debunked John Cook study.  Pnewell, you should ask him if censorship is a valid way to convince deniers of climate change, given that they [HEAVILY censor /r/science from even the most innocent skeptics.](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/)    I would, but they banned me for posting peer reviewed evidence that debunked the horseshit that Dr Mann was posting.
[Here you go](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=denmark+tax+rate)
&gt;the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology voted Thursday to cut deeply into NASA's budget for Earth science, in a clear swipe at the study of climate change.  After this clearly opinionated opening, I can't wait for this "journalist" to *show* his thesis as opposed to just *telling* us what he thinks the Republicans were doing in decreasing this particular spending.  And I can't wait to read the quotes from Republicans that the author of this piece, Michael Hiltzik, surely sought out.  &gt;The budget plan perfectly reflects the House GOP's glorification of space exploration, which masks its disdain for research on climate change.  Again, the author is *telling* us the intentions of the Republicans.  I look forward to him *showing* us, via facts or quotes, about these intentions.  &gt;The Earth Science division, the organization continued, helped monitor the movement of oil into Gulf of Mexico coastal waters after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, track severe storms and tornadoes, and assisted with flood predictions and earthquake response.   I appreciate the fear mongering, but the author never elaborates on why things like this couldn't *still happen* with NASA's proposed budget of $1.45 BILLION.  And that's not even NASA's entire budget.  That's the budget for the Earth Science department of NASA.    &gt;Earth science got one mention, and that one was an undisguised political slam: "The Obama administration has consistently cut funding for ... human space exploration programs, **while increasing funding for the Earth Science Division by more than 63 percent.**"  If this is true, it's not even a cut.  If Obama increases it 63% and the Republicans cut it 20%, that's still a net increase in funding.    &gt;What kind, indeed? This kind.  And the author never *shows* us this "clear swipe at the study of climate change" by the Republicans.  He simply told us his opinion about it and portrayed it as fact.  Forget any quotes from Republicans or any context into the historical budget of the Earth Science division, let's just write an article based entirely on the author's opinion and only feature quotes from people who agree with the author.    This is modern journalism's use of the informed attribute.  Tell.  Don't show.   
And they did reduce taxes ... how'd that work out? You DID notice the article was 10 years old I assume...
Oh god, this irony is just too much to handle.

&gt; not all of us voted.  Ftfy
&gt;That would be a terrible idea. Kind of like how, if you've ever negotiated for a new job and salary, you don't give out your current wage first as it puts you at a disadvantage.  That's great and all, and maybe you could say that diplomatic cables and work product about what the US does and doesn't value should be classified. But the treaty drafts themselves are presumably being sent around to the different countries. Releasing them wouldn't be telling any of them anything they don't know. Keeping them secret only keeps them secret from the citizens of those countries.
You misquoted the [consensus](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article). It says that 66.4% of studies had no opinion while 32.6% agreed. In that number of 32.6%, 97.1% believe its human caused and that number has only increased marginally over time. (Definition: Marginally - Slightly). That definitely shows the opinion is split.
It's not a big deal, really, but I've reached the point where I can no longer interact with 'mainstream' Republicans.  What was once the party of civil rights pioneers, early conservationists, and even an Eisenhower that warned of the "military industrial complex" has devolved into something that eschews carbon dating yet worships the same bombs that are made using the same scientific principles because it runs contrary to the Jesus on a dinosaur mantra, casts its national defense with mercenaries, and pursues a system of economic neo-feudalism.    Being 'conservative' didn't always used to mean you were a luddite.  The only way this party ever succeeds is through discouragement of voters and discipline within its dogmatic congregations.

Come on /r/politics, you can do better than this, 68% upvoted? What about 10% upvoted? We can do it
/r/politics, please be better than this.  I know the circlejerk is so far gone there's no hope of anything resembling actual political discussion here, but *please* be better than upvoting sensationalist clickbait titles like this one.  This isn't journalism and it doesn't deserve the exposure you're giving it.
That standard exists because of the supreme court case that was cited. If we get rid of the Supreme Court ruling it stands to reason we go back to the behavior the Supreme Court outlawed
"The most transparent administration in history" 
Granted there is a lot wrong with the voting system, but voting is not going to solve this issue. The reason we have this issue is because people voted, for the same senators that cut the funding.  I think the core of this issue is education and lack of common sense and failure to apply logic.  On top of that Democrats and republican both are involved in their fair share of stupidity.   The people can't win when those running for government are the ones we have to settle on.   Look at the possible scenario we are about to face in the upcoming presedential elections Democrats: Hillary Clinton Republican: Possibly Ted Cruz  Seriously, neither of these people are a good fit for the office of the president, if that is what the presidential race comes down to, then you are screwed either way, it does not matter how many people vote.  I honestly don't have any idea how this can be fixed. I just dont 
Both fast track authority and TPP deserve to be shot down in flames over the underhanded and secretive manner in which the Obama Administration has pursued them both.  Given that Free Trade has only served to harm most Americans economically, existing U.S. free trade agreements must be repealed and sensible U.S. trade regulations fully restored.  It's time to repeal Reaganomic madness and restore the sensible and effective U.S. economic/fiscal policies and legislation that existed before 1980 (1968 (aka the Nixon era), in some cases).

That's a sliding scale though. I definitely wouldn't say that "all serious candidates" have it or require it.  If someone has executive experience, the opposing side's criticism is that they don't have legislative experience. If someone has legislative experience, the criticism is that they don't have executive experience.    Not that I support her by any means, I just think we can come up with better criticisms of her than the fact that she fails to meet some arbitrary prerequisite.   I mean, if I was ever seriously entertaining the possibility of voting for her, the fact that she does not have legislative experience would deter me about as much as the fact that Obama did not have executive experience.  Or look at it this way: if Elon Musk was running for president, would you be deterred by the fact that he has never been a legislator?
Know your audience and pander to them. There is a simple logic here.
&gt; If you dont like what users vote in /r/politics[1] the is a button next on the sidebar that says Unsubscribe.  That's his entire point. /r/politics is much more about what people want to hear about, and less about what is actually going on. Most subs have that problem, but /r/politics is unique in that it is the sole source of political information for many people. Not many NFL fans only go to /r/NFL for their NFL news, but that is the case for a good number of /r/politics users (per past surveys).   
As of now he has my vote. The GOP just pisses me off with how dumb they are. They know there are just enough idiots to vote for them.
After negotiations everything is public and will be open for discussion for a standard amount of time. This is the norm, for some reason (mainly since no one here understands how the process works), thinks this is a bad thing.  Normally most of the other TPP posts have a top comment on how this process works in regards to standard government procedure.
There are plenty of other teams devoted to climate change. NASA is supposed to focusing on air and space. Let other people do the earth science. I'm pretty sure this has been discussed before.
No its definitely split. No opinion means no conclusion could be made.  And when you look at it this way according to those two percentages only 31.7% of all the publications claimed it was man made (.326*.971*100). So of the rest of the 68.3% of the publications, 97.2% found no conclusion. This is obviously not split in my favor now. There i used misleading statistics just like you did. But this is obviously not the case. You have to look at the whole of the publications.   * 66.4% found no conclusion.   * 32.6%  Concluded Global Warming Existed.  * * Of that 97.1% said it was man-made.  * 0.7% Concluded it did not exist.   * 0.3% Were uncertain of the causes of Global Warming.  You are being misleading.  I will read your article and edit my comment if i see anything of merit.
There would be so damned many lawsuits just on Obama's birth certificate alone. This would be abused.
This made me laugh out loud, but slowly transitioned into a pathetic sob. How brazenly some politicians can deceive people, politicians that people put their hopes in, is disgusting.  To put Obama in the context of the many centuries of the black liberation movement depresses me. This is a guy that took the oath of MLK's bible, while he cracks [drone jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWKG6ZmgAX4). MLK on the other hand was the guy who called the US the greatest purveyor of violence in the world. The hypocrisy is staggering.

No, it's not the first time.  There's a reason why federal agencies are currently barred from funding research into guns and gun violence, for one example.
The gag order is a lot more than "bothersome."  The whole problem with this situation is that it lets the prosecutor publicly harass someone and leave them with no defense.  They can't talk to their neighbors to tell them what's going on, they can't defend themselves in the press, and the can't get an attorney to counter the prosecution or prepare a criminal defense.  To my knowledge, no one was ever even charged as a result of this most recent round of searches, so they may never get a chance to defend themselves.  Also, this was a dawn raid conducted by SWAT teams.  That's usually reserved for the worst situations, involving serious crimes and potentially dangerous defendants.  The prosecutor could have instead issued a subpoena, which would be more typical.  But that would have allowed the defendants to seek counsel, which apparently wasn't what the prosecutor wanted.  If we are going to accept that this is the right way for prosecutors to gather evidence or to conduct a search, then it will become the new standard.  And yes, a judge did approve of this thing.  But that doesn't make it any fairer to me.  It's shocking to me that this is even an option for prosecutors.  Like civil forfeiture, this is a tactic that is clearly ripe for abuse and should be banned.

I think to up turnout we *need* voting stations in more places, and more convenient places.  Every Target, Home Depot and Walmart should be a polling area. 
&gt; It's mathematical gymnastics to make it look like funding was increased, but it wasn't. He's using block grants to meet pension obligations and counting that as increased student spending.  Education funding is education funding.  If the Dept of Education wants to spend it on pensions instead of students, so be it.  But at the end of the day, education is receiving more money than ever before, so blaming school closings on lack of funds due to lower tax revenues is misleading.  &gt; The people who are in the top tax bracket keep more of their money, while the rest of us pay for them to have that privilege. It isn't sustainable for anyone except the wealthy.  There are a number of states with no income tax that would disagree with this statement.

I am curious if the poll would differ if there were a control question that said something like "**Jesus was a cunt**" - you know, for science.   Are Americans truly ok with the right to offend, or just the right to offend others?
&gt; If you aren't going to contribute a portion of the discussion don't comment in the subreddit. All you are doing is cutting down comments and being negative.   I'm pointing out a very common occurrence in this sub of people claiming to be Republicans while agreeing with a hard-line Democratic platform. Obviously, you haven't seen this (very difficult to believe) or you actually believe that these people have completely flipped their ideology overnight because of Bernie Sanders (hopefully you don't believe this).  &gt;I'm one of them. My brother is on board. Plenty of friends who normally vote republican is ready to vote for bernie.  So, how did your entire ideology change overnight? I'd love to hear this.  &gt;Like I've said. Just because you vote republican once doesn't mean you have to keep voting republican.   Nope, but you don't go from one end of the spectrum to supporting the furthest left member of the United States Congress overnight. The only way this is believable is if you put zero thought into why you voted Republican, and you are putting the same amount of thought into why you support Bernie now.  &gt;Get your head unburried from your own little world and be inviting to whoever wants to vote for bernie sanders.  Sorry, I don't buy into your pretend stories for pretend internet points. There is an incredible amount of irony in this sentence, which you obviously don't see. You realize, that you are in /r/politics trying to criticize someone else for burying their head in the sand and living in their own little world? That's incredibly ironic. 
It includes a lot of things, some addressing IP and some addressing trade barriers (which do indeed still exist).

 As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he was among the panelists questioning witnesses about the 2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, stating he was "outraged by the outrage" over the revelations of abuse. Although he believed that the individuals responsible for mistreating prisoners should be punished, he stated that the prisoners "are not there for traffic violations . . . they're murderers, they'reterrorists, they're insurgents".[27][28] In 2006, Inhofe was one of only nine senators to vote against the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005which prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment of individuals in U.S. Governmentcustody.  You really know how to pick em
If it was about trade, it would just push to remove trade barriers instead of policy. It's not about trade, which is why many pro trade economists have come out against it.
The rock star new Senator who had lit capitol hill on fire with excitement? He was about 7-2 at announcement, 2nd only to Hillary
No, free trade policies for countries are decoupled with the income inequality question. Comparative advantage is real. Inequality is fostered by higher returns on capital than economic growth. You can have a more egalitarian society by having robust public finance with low barriers to trade; Then foreign countries are essentially like robots producing goods or any other productivity enhancement. Those also foster economic growth also, but also foster income and wealth inequality in the absence of robust public finance. 
The one thing I need to know: These Muslims just did much more than organizers ever could themselves to prove their point. 
Out of all the GOP nominees, I think Fiorina has the potential of standing out the most.  She's not part of the "establishment" which means she's not associated with the baggage that comes from being part of an institution with single-digit approval ratings (i.e. congress).  Her positions make sense, like the one in the OP.  Yes, she's got no political experience outside of running for [California senate in 2010, thanks for the correction], but she's got experience leading a corporation that [employs] tens of thousands of employees.  A true dark-horse candidate.
&gt; If you took a second to research or ask what I believe, you'd see that I'm far from a denialist. I'm just not a doomsday chicken little running around while the sky falls.  So you're a contemporary denialist, a luke warmist. That's the next branch, when there's just nothing to cling on to by actually trying to deny the whole thing then it's time to try to downplay it. Calling global warming advocacy doomsday chickens is a strawman argument. I believe the point is that there are enough adverse effects projected to warrant drastic reduction of co2 emissions.  Saying the global warming does not present a clear danger goes a long way in showing how little you have actually bothered to look into the topic scientifically. But yes, rising sea levels is not among the biggest and most immediate problems.  If you're genuinely interested here's about them adverse effects: https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-basic.htm

How the fuck did he even get that position. I doubt I even want to know.
He's been slapped by the Republicans so many times he's decided to take their strategy of doubling down on stupid.
I would still like to hear both sides of the argument. Can anyone actually back this shit up without sounding like a nutcase?
If Hillary voters can look past all her flaws, I think Carly Fiorina definitely has a fighting chance.
The purpose in this case is because there are so many interests involved they don't want the bill to sit out there forever and then have riders attached left and right from every special interest group under the sun adding unrelated pet projects as part of the bill.
DEA Bernie Sanders?
I've heard the argument that a single volcano eruption releases X times more CO2 than all human activity in Y number of years.    [This argument is wrong and we've known it to be wrong for a while, but that hasn't stopped them.](http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2007/07_02_15.html)  Another argument is the fact that we're in an Ice Age and historically the earth has spent more time without any polar icecaps whatsoever than it has spent with Ice caps and we're just moving out of the ice age.  It's a weird argument because many of the same people who'd want to make that argument also believe in a young-earth (that the earth is roughly 6k years old).
Does that change the fact that they are total bigots?

If your talking about a few little churches scattered throughout the country that have just a few members trying to support it, I'll give you that. But the churches we are talking about in NO way are NON-PROFIT. They have so much non profit money that they feel obligated to sway politicians to impose laws upon this nation that are geared toward your own sadistic religious views not unlike this Isis group of nut cases. Show me one paster of of any of these mega churches that doesn't know how non-profit works for them. As a devout athiest it sickens me to see the downfall of this great country because of religious people's backward views of life !!!! 
That's a pretty biased headline, both from OP and MotherJones.
Everyone is treated equally...just some people are treated more equally than others...great mindset. 
Abortion is not birth control and it's societally unhealthy to pretend it is.  A better solution is to really emphasize these people to wrap up and take every conceivable precaution before having sex if they don't want a kid, especially if they can't afford to raise one.  That's a far better long-term solution then telling people "oh don't worry, if something happens you'll be able to get an abortion just like that".   
Her legacy with HP was that she merged HP and Compaq and created the industry leader that beat its competition for over 10 years afterward.  There was a lot of controversy over it, but it proved to be the right move going forward for both HP and Compaq.  Any Fortune 500 CEO is going to retire in wealth, and companies generally speaking feud with labor all the time.    Yes, senate in 2010, thanks for the correction. For whatever reason I fuse her run with Meg Whitman's.  She actually voted for Prop 8, i.e. defining marriage as between a man and a woman...that's something I don't necessarily agree on.  I also remember her being pro-life as well.  IMHO her history essentially boils down to how you think she managed HP.  I thought she did great, and HP's dominant position is a direct result of the merger she pushed through as CEO.  Outside of that, she's a California Republican.
Show me where I'm wrong that the actions of the "Christians" are not Christian.  The people who hold contests like this are slandering the name of Christianity.  Quit trying to hide behind the Muslims and face what Christianity is becoming.

I fully support him as well and will gladly vote for him in the primary. But inevitably, I don't see him winning in the long run. But I hope he does..
Yes, absolutely this. On the other hand, I had an amazing public school education and know for a fact that we learned all about different political and economic philosophies. Despite that fact, so many people who were in my class for years make ignorant statements on FB about socialism/fascism/communism, etc, etc.  Some of them sat right next to me in school, so what happened? Did I retain more information than they did? Or are they being disingenuous? 
The point is that the Democratic nominee is going to be a woman. That the next President is going to be the first woman in the White House, following the first black President. Both of whom are Democrats.   In the meantime, the Republicans are going to go Old White Guy/Old White Guy #2. If they're being extra progressive this time, they might let Marco Rubio be the VP pick. 
&gt;Hardly supports your position that they "basically write the treaty". Do you have any evidence that they do?  "They make recommendations to the USTR. "  The way the world works, that's writing the treaty. They get to see advanced drafts, they get their input on how the drafts should be changed, and they generally get their way given how the treaties come out so heavily in their favor. The representatives of the people don't get this input. It's presented to them as a fait accompli.   The leaks of ACTA materials showed us the influence the corporations have. 
Nothing to apologize for.  Edit:  I hope this article is read far and wide and people can see for themselves rather than forming opinions based on talking points and sound bites.
That's because Americans know that DEMAND creates jobs, not stuffing rich people's pockets, fuller.  There was a great interview I saw about this.   In Kansas, they were interviewing some farmer, who when asked if he would use his tax cut to hire someone, he laughed, said "I've got enough employees already".     "What will you do with the tax cut"?  "Keep it". 
Ehhh...I mean the full report points out that it's impossible to determine what % of those cost reductions are a result of ACA and what % are a result of the economies being on their ass. Attributing this entirely to ACA is a very disingenuous interpretation by VOX.

Get out of here with your logic. Hillary is literally Hitler in the eyes of reddit. 
Perhaps if the industry didn't treat the welders like indentured servants there would be more people willing to do it.   I have a pal who is a pipe welder fresh out of one of those schools. They pay him like 15 an hour and make him clock 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Mandatory overtime.   He has to do that for 3-5 years before he has enough seniority to be able to work only 50-60 hours a week.   It's hilarious because he makes a lot of money. But lives out of his truck. He has a gym membership for the shower facilities. And he sleeps in his truck. He doesn't have time to do anything else but work and sleep. So there is no reason for him to do anything else. He is saving a shit load of money though.   Fuck that. The trades have historically treated their supposed skilled tradesmen like disposable machines. Ground to nothing and discarded when permanently broken. 
Actually college costs are worsening because of political solutions intended to expand education, such as higher subsidies. Many schools respond to these "solutions" by increasing tuition to meet the excessive demand generated by students, many of whom choose redundant majors. To Bernie Sanders, every single problem is the fault of the rich. His understanding of basic economics is too shrouded in class warfare and resentment politics. 
&gt;Thirty-two hospital systems signed up to become Pioneer ACOs in 2012 (13 have since dropped out)  So, they're saving about $20 million per hospital system. That's actually really impressive. I suppose the next step is to make participation mandatory. 
So lets see what the republicans fly in?
Bullshit, we call out on being bigoted against other religions all the time
&gt; There's nothing 'healthy' about using cheap labor in one country to make products that will be sold in another  There are plenty of healthy things about that. Those cheap laborers have jobs, the shipping industry has jobs, and consumers have lower prices/greater utility. Even if the labor is cheap, their prices are almost always low where their purchasing power isn't bad.
I mean yeah, it's really just giving the GOP what they want if people are tempted to think that way.  They *want* people to think that conservative = Republican, because that's the easiest way to get poor religious people to vote for the businessmen who want to kick them to the streets, then jail them for living there.
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age  The Islamic world was once a pretty awesome place for the time period.  Much of the classic literature that survives today (Such as Greek philosophy and theatre) was preserved by Islamic scholars.  Our modern decimal system was imported from India by Muslims and the scientific method was pioneered during this time period.  Christians and Jews lived just fine in Muslim-controlled territory.  This was all while Christian Europe was in the throws of the dark ages.  It's a shame that the modern Muslim world is so different.
Only because it took so fucking long to get there.

Holy shit you're dumb. The 97% figure comes from *published scientific papers expressing an opinion on the cause of climate change*, not random people being polled.
I want to see what they are spending their taxpayer funded income on !
&gt;He has to show he understands it   It might behoove you to read up on Sen. Sanders.  He definitely understands the progressive movement, and he is definitely committed to fighting for real change.  Check him out on [ontheissues.org](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Bernie_Sanders.htm).  And check out some of his speeches on Youtube.
Yeah dude, because [christians are a model of tolerance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre)    Somebody needs to go re-read Matthew 7:4-5.
Poverty is cyclical and our failing schools are all in impoverished areas. The poor can't as readily provide a proper environment for their kids as their middle class counterparts can, and I believe that is the reason for the divide. To break the cycle of poverty someone in the family needs to get a leg up. I think entitlements like health care and education being offered to everyone would help a lot with that. They empower people to better their situation through legitimate means. Higher education is an investment in ourselves that pays dividends. I think that is why Scandinavia has only 5% of children living in poverty compared to our 22%. They have had these programs for generations while we have not. Yes the effects may not be immediate but a quick fix isn't always existent. The world is not a magical place.
ITT: no one has read the article.  It is a proposed spending bill which has two levels of funding for NASA; both of which actually comport with Obama's requests for the agency. The outline [presented here](http://www.spacepolicyonline.com/news/earth-science-takes-hit-in-proposed-house-nasa-authorization-bill) breaks down the funds for each program presented by the bill, in short:  &gt;Top-line funding for NASA would be the same as the President’s FY2016 budget request ($18.5 billion) under the aspirational level or the same as its current funding ($18.0 billion) under the constrained scenario.  Overall, the bill favors human space exploration, planetary science, and astrophysics.  ...  &gt;In total, the aspirational level for FY2016 is the same as the President’s request of $18.529 billion.  The constrained level is what NASA received for FY2015 -- $18.010 billion.   ..  &gt;NASA’s earth science program is funded at $1.773 billion in FY2015.  The request for FY2016 is $1.947 billion.   Under the bill’s aspirational scenario, it would receive $1.450 billion in FY2016.  Under the constrained scenario, it would receive $1.199 billion.  Using current funding and the aspirational scenario for FY2016, it would be an approximately 18 percent cut.  Compared to the President’s request, it would be a roughly 26 percent cut.  If the BCA caps are not removed and the constrained scenario plays out for FY2016, it would be about a 32 percent cut compared to current funding or a 38 percent cut compared to the President’s request.  &gt;By comparison, NASA’s human exploration program – the Space Launch System (SLS), Orion, and associated ground systems – and planetary science and astrophysics fare much better. The commercial crew program is fully funded under the aspirational scenario.  ..  &gt;SLS is currently funded at $1.7 billion.  The President’s request would reduce that to $1.357 billion.  The House bill would restore it to $1.7 billion for FY2016 under either the aspirational or constrained scenarios.  ..  &gt;Planetary science, another congressional favorite, is funded at $1.438 billion this year and the President’s request would cut that down to $1.361 billion.  The House bill instead would raise it to $1.5 billion regardless of what happens with the BCA caps.   tl;dr: NASA is still funded exactly the same as projected; Congress diverts a percentage of funds from certain programs to other programs at its discretion.
They will.  We all will.
What does Sen. Sanders have to do with the Drug Enforcement Agency?

Yup. As long as we live on this planet, climate change is a national security issue.
Waiting periods on firearms purchases help prevent emotional decisions like using a gun for homicide/suicide. Waiting periods for abortions (with available but non-mandatory counselling) could similarly help women making a very emotional decision be absolutely sure that it is the choice they want to make.  I'm NOT comparing abortion to murder or suicide, I'm comparing the emotional nature of the decisions.

&gt;Two-thirds of the state’s members of American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) have dropped out, causing membership to plummet from 63,000 to less than 20,000.   Despite what most liberals think, Walker isn't attacking worker's rights. In fact, it's quite the opposite. When people are given the choice of whether or not they want to be part of a union, not surprisingly most of them choose to opt out. 
You guys are delusional. The man is on tape calling himself a socialist. The major news networks could ruin him in 24 hours. America is not over their rampant fear of socialism. It won't happen. He's unelectable. 
Good point - he's probably going to *need* Secret Service protection too, given how strongly a certain segment of the population hates him. 
You'd still have to prove standing.
No, but you compared my argument to one of a liberal. Thus insinuating I was one. 
So I take it NPR is pro-terrorism and anti-free speech?
&gt;Walker isn't attacking worker's rights.  LOL right to organize = "crush the unions!"  &gt;When people are given the choice of whether or not they want to be part of a union, not surprisingly most of them choose to opt out.   Um...people have to vote to form a union. What you are looking at is whether people want to pay for the union if they get the same benefits either way. Its like telling someone they can keep all the infrastructure but not pay taxes.
One thing to know about NPR.  It leads with a comment against the Free Speech event organizing group by an irredeemably partisan and hate-spreading group that was responsible for pumping the hatred against the Family Resources Council.   In August 2011 a zealot FOR gay marriage, having researched "HATE GROUPS" on the Southern Poverty Center's web site, set off that weekday morning to kill as many as he could at DC's office of the FRC.  He shot one guard, but was himself stopped.    Yes, it that that murderous hatred inflaming group , the SPLC that NPR goes running to for the lead quote.   They are no better that the Arabic Press in Arabic that passes along the hatred for Jews, Christians, and "apostate" Muslims and Muslim communities from hate mongering mullahs.    Which is EXACTLY the people the brave woman, Pam Geller, has been attacking -- the hate mongerers of Islam.    But we have our own too.   For example: the SDLC, and its mouthpiece NPR.   Promoting murderous hatreds against fellow Americans. 
&gt; Federal policies apparently can pierce liberal states and cities and make them 3rd world shit holes, but can't penetrate southern states and keep blacks poor, even they they are policies targeted at poverty.  yes because state and local polices obviously wouldn't effect the outcomes here at all, and there can't account for the difference in outcome between states at all. nope no sir, nothing to do with republican polices at all.  &gt; This is the fantasy world that the left constructs so they can continue to believe their failed ideology isn't a failed ideology. Its like Evangelical s when talking about God.  uhmm you just tried to argue that only federal polices matter and that nothing else would effect outcomes thereby, in your mind, absolving republican policies of all blame, AND you have yet to acknowledge that the US's far more conservative policies have resulted in far worse outcomes for the poor overall then in the rest of the developed world.  the evidence is staring your right in the face and you shut your eye's and tell the rest of us to walk follow you as you walk off the cliff.  the mental hoops you must jump through to keep yourself absolved from all blame must be mind blogging.

&gt;  I like Sanders and all but he doesn't have a shot.  Not with that attitude.  If you really support Bernie, then get off your ass.  Sign up to volunteer for his campaign; donate money.
This article is primarily about how we should not federalize the police.  &gt;Instead, if we're really serious about increasing law enforcement accountability, we should end civil service protections for federal employees, while outlawing public employee unions. We should also abolish governmental immunity for federal, state, and local employees, forcing them to face civil lawsuits for illegal behavior, just as the rest of us must do.  He makes good arguments for increasing accountability for law enforcement, but he just slips in outlawing unions without mentioning it before or establishing a rational argument against it?  WTF?
No, it's not. It is important to note, though, that was in no way a "free speech," event. It was a calculated anti-Islam event that was tied to the passage of an "anti-Sharia" measure by the Texas legislature. Geller doesn't care about free speech. She wants to see Islam eliminated. Period.
Hard to launch a space craft when Florida is under water. 
I'm totally cool with it.  Not because of warming but because I don't think it's NASAs job. It's NOAA if anything.  Give it to NOAA instead.  NASA is for space ships. I know one of the As is for atmosphere, but still.
I agree.  But they do have to account for themselves, don't they?

It was very much a free speech event, and YOU show the kind of attitude that brought on hanging mobs in the post-Civil War south, that during the turn of the 20th century's waves of "unwashed" immigrants and southern blacks moving north caused millions of Wilsonian Democrats to join the KKK, burn crosses and terrorize blacks and immigrants.

Why don't you focus on the content that was provided instead of attacking content providers?  Do have credible evidence which refutes what they have revealed?  If so, let's see what you have other than that knee jerk emotional reaction to the content providers involved.
I don't miss or disagree with that point. I find the framing of the issue as "republican governor giving tax break to right wing religious reality show" wildly dishonest.

She's turned over all the relevant emails but because they didn't find the one where she's trading recipes with Al Qaida they just know she's up to something.

The is no logic or thinking involved with those types, no need to ask for a reason
I watched his speech live and at the time he just seemed enthusiastic.  I didn't think anything of it. Certainly nothing negative.  Fox was accused of modifying the audio, but I don't know if that was true.
  Like I said, i am very familiar with him. he appears on Hartmann every Fri.. "Lunch With Bernie" I get his emails. But he has to find a platform that is progressive and will still get him elected. That may be a tough needle to thread. He is labelled a socialist. Most Americans do not know what that is, but they do not like it.
...and thankfully so.   One thing I really like about him is his "don't underestimate me" but nevertheless "we have a long road ahead of us" attitude.   He's optimistic, but also realistic.  He recognizes that it will take a lot to win, but he isn't about to let himself get written off.
No, I'm not saying that anyone who wants compensation for innovation is a rent seeker, rather the notion of intellectual property promotes rent seeking to the point where we might want to consider alternative models of promoting innovation. Public finance awards for use for example where necessary, but usually first mover advantage is enough.  Pushing the IP model globally isn't about trade either, because it's by definition "non-rivalrous."
Personally I haven't seen a single candidate on either side I like so far.   Enjoy the hype train while it lasts, I'm just offering a perspective you won't get in this small echo chamber reddit has created here. Many working class people won't give two shits about half of Sanders talking points.  My "wrong" opinion has zero evidence, just like yours. That's why it's an opinion.

Well I actually just had this debate in another thread. I'm not going to pretend to know much about pharmaceutical patent law. But my only question is, if government funding is such a better alternative to privatized pharma with intellectual property, why do the US and Switzerland lead the world in pharmaceutical innovation? If a government funding model worked better, it would work better, don't you think? And don't you think countries like Switzerland would be smart enough to realize it works better and implement it? Instead Switzerland spends its time fighting with India to protect the intellectual property of Swiss pharma. Is it just a coincidence that all the innovators promote international intellectual property/patent rights? Shouldn't the countries that use government funding models create more and better medicines?   Pharma is the main TPP example I can think of, not sure what other industries are targeted for international copyright enforcement. 
You'd bankrupt the country in a day. There would be 100 million Benghazi lawsuits instantly filed, each with less than no standing whatsoever, legal, ethical or moral.

Why vote for lesser evils. Cthulhu for president 2016 
Of course she can.  She's basically the only running to get enough national recognition to get a spot at VP, and they might go for a women like her to help counterbalance against the fact that Hillary is a women.  At that point, all you need is a death or resignation and you have yourself a failure of a CEO as president.
Holy fuck, thank you.  This shit is getting older than Bernie himself.
&gt;  You are simply parroting things you have heard and don't understand.  I was originally going to just repost "Oh, sweet irony!", but I think it's actually even funnier to point back to [how this conversation started](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/34nt71/inside_the_senates_big_vote_on_whether_climate/cqwttr0) with you parroting talking points you have heard and don't understand, while I was the one making my own, novel criticisms.  Keep digging, though!
The reason why it produces more 'innovation' is because so much money is spent on drugs that yield profits. But the innovation isn't especially efficient. Patent produces antacids and boner pills instead of antibiotics and vaccines to secure enormous returns for shareholders, at great social cost. And it's not copyright.  If you want that sort of innovation, just throw the same money at the pharmaceutical companies directly for development instead of indirectly through monopoly rights monetization (where most of the money goes to marketing instead) and let generics actually compete for the best manufacturing lines, and we can still have more antacids and boner pills. But then we actually have the option of substituting some of that funding for antibiotics and vaccines instead if we decide that living in the post-antibiotic era isn't such a great thing after all.

As loathsome as the police unions are, they are doing their jobs: protecting their own.   Going after police unions is just classic right wing divide and conquer. No sale. We can deal with this another way.

Because, Benghazi.
  I am not sure. He was a surgeon, so he may not need the money. Listen to his talk and he is a bit off the deep end. 
I don't think he matters as much as Reddit wants to think he does. He is a 73 year old independent socialist who wants to dismantle big businesses. Little else, though. He has little to no chance of actually winning as he is the Ted Cruz of the left. The vast majority of the country will dismiss him without second thought.
"Education funding is education funding." - No it's not. Education funding is actually broken up into a few areas such as: employee funding and supplies as examples. One cannot simply just raid another section of funding to cover another. Funding the pension (which Kansas had finally come close to being caught up on funding after several years of being behind) has nothing to do with the rising costs of supplies or the rising costs of utilities for buildings.
Okay, so where are all the antibiotics and vaccines being invented in countries that don't embrace the US' model? 
Fiorina was made CEO of HP at the start of the tech bubble bursting.  It isn't uncommon for companies to give a woman or a minority a chance at the CEO hat just prior to troubles... Then the problems are shouldered on them.  What makes Fiorina a terrifying candidate is her blase commenting *on record* saying that the only thing she would do differently relating to the 30,000 layoffs was that she **would do [the layoffs] faster**.  Sometimes positions are made obsolete or can be done somewhere else at a more favorable rate for the company.  But there is a line that got crossed and she put herself in a place where it wouldn't be unfair to claim that she was *gloating* about laying off 30,000 people.

Protect the rights of workers to collectively bargain, regardless of the actions of a minority of departments of police officers -- workers who represent a small portion of organized labor in America. 
The fact that the Social Security is only taxed up to just over $100,000 is absolutely sickening. And instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, the GOP solution is to slash benefits of an already criminally regressive tax system.   Obliterate the upward cap, let the 1% pay their damn fair share, and Social Security will be okay until my grandkids are dust. 
This is Texas, where the religious right just elected religious talk show host Dan ("I promise to govern as god wants") Patrick as Lt Gov.   The legislature is about to give another $100 million in taxpayer funds to religious schools.   By destroying women's healthcare programs, they quadrupled the maternal death rate.   A freshman member of the state legislature proposed legislation that took $3 million from an HIV prevention program to fund abstinence only sex education. He's a physician, who was proudly a virgin until he married at age 29.   Sex education? Ha! "It encourages kids to have sex."

Why are all of these threads full of comments that totally are ignoring the reality of polling? Sanders is no where near Clinton currently in the polling data. I guess it is just willful ignorance, or ignorance of how the actual system works.

It's not about officers, police unions are sick at the highest levels.  [This](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/nyregion/at-rikers-a-roadblock-to-reform.html) is a good example, how unions defended the killer of [Kelly Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kelly_Thomas) is another one, but the list goes on and on.  At this point, for protesters in Baltimore to achieve what they want police unions will have to lose power.
When cap gains rates go up, people don't sell imvestments and instead hang on to bad investments. That's bad for the economy and it also cuts revenue.  Your comment about financial engineering is just made up.
And if you read my comment, I offered three big accomplishments from the past year.  &gt;But more recently, he successfully led the push against the Comcast/TW merger (which given the number of public comments on NN, is clearly important to a lot of Americans), he's been a vocal opponent of the TPP, and as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Sanders in 2014 passed legislation reforming the VA health care system. Congressional Quarterly said he was able “to bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.”

The amount of excuse making in your posts is hilarious.  You know, I voted for Obama too, but that doesn't mean you have to defend some of his obviously terrible decisions with stances like "at least we aren't carpet bombing anymore, so I guess LESS innocent civilians are dying"....I mean really, listen to yourself.  If you told me that Obama would bomb more countries than Bush, he wouldn't have gotten my vote. On a number of issues he's been absolutely unforgivable.
Sorry. I don't see it. Changing the tone of the debate in the primaries won't change anything because Hillary can say all the same things Bernie does. Tough on Wall Street blah blah blah. And Hillary will be more believeable except what she says and what she'll do will not be the same thing. If Bernie doesn't win, it will be the same as if he didn't run.
&gt; Hillary doesn't excite younger, more liberal voters. Bernie does. Older, more moderate voters are more likely to show up and vote Dem no matter what. Also, since younger voters are generally less likely to vote, picking up their votes has a bigger impact on election outcomes.   I think this is the key to his winning the election. As a soon-to-be 18 year old, the thought of voting for Hillary doesn't excite me. It would be a vote against the GOP, rather than a vote for a candidate I could completely support. Bernie, on the other hand, has me both excited and optimistic for the future; he's someone I feel I can truly believe in, and a lot of others my age seem to feel the same way.  I love your username, by the way. Vonnegut was a genius.

Well our own troops kill brown people abroad with impunity. I don't see why you think the state or the military are trustworthy, given the fact that they routinely repress marginalized groups at home and abroad in order to protect the capitalist class.  This is basic history, the US was able to develop economically by enslaving an entire ethnic group and driving another one from the lands they had inhabitted for thousands of years. After that, it has routinely meddled in the affairs of other states in order to protect the interests of Western capital, leaving millions dead or tortured in its wake.  Whatever your political convictions are -and trust me, Cruz and I have absolutely nothing in common when it comes to that-, the fact is that the US government is not trustworthy.

Those emails were the property of the US government and not Hillary. It's a good thing her name is nothing like "Aaron Swartz".
Is she the one that ran HP into the ground?
None of what you're saying is true. 
Why?  Most people realize that Hillary is basically a neocon as far as foreign policy and corporate/banking issues are concerned.  Most people realize she has already been purchased by wall street.  As more of the issues with her "charity" come to light, she will look worse and worse.  I am completely flabbergasted that she is considered a viable candidate for the democrats.  She is the poster child for things you would assume they hate.    Is there a country to bomb?  Hillary is for it.  Scumbag banksters?  Hillary is their bought and paid for candidate! Oligarch friends who rely on government welfare, like Lady Lynn Rothschild and Warren Buffet?  They love her!  The Lady Rothschild already informed the press that Hillary will not be implementing populist policies.  Do people really want to vote for a tool of the Bilderburg set?  How the hell can she be the democratic favorite when on issues of money and war, she is a dick Cheney clone?  Don't get the false meme stuck in your head that Hillary is it. 
Baltimore has a [GDP of $157 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_GDP), so that's a 0.17% stimulus over Obama's 6.5 years in office.  It's continually amazing to me how small minded conservatives are when it comes to money, and how little they understand it.
[“No matter what I do, I will not be a spoiler,” Sanders said. “I will not play that role in helping to elect some right-wing Republican as President of the United States.”](http://inthesetimes.com/article/17572/bernie_sanders_president)

Why do these people do this? I'm not talking any specific party either. This is so totally lame. Who are the creatives involved with this? Granted, the creatives could have told them not to do this. 
&gt; When cap gains rates go up, people don't sell imvestments and instead hang on to bad investments.  When the hell has that ever been true?

I'm curious--what issues matter to you? What voting record are you looking for in that moderate republican? How do you want your candidate to vote?   Sanders has touched on many issues that are important to me and I agree with his stances on many of them. I am an average working class american--not just some idealist redditor. 
He knows just as much about economics as your intolerable uncle does that talks about politics during Thanksgiving dinner. College drop out.

This seems like a hit piece of Bernie and his ideas. Constantly stating how the odds are sooo long and all that bullshit. As if the only people who get to decide arnt those people that Bernie has litearlly stood up for for over 40 years. The track record is there for the first time since I can remember. This is a man of the people. If someone like that has a "long" shot, our future has a long shot. 
Holy Shit that's an amazing quote, and an accurate one. Thank you.   And fuck LBJ.
Federal control of our schools is a colossal failure.  Disband the Department of Education.

Commit cultural suicide progressive? Do you think us Jews are a problem? He believes that Saudi Arabia, with the third greatest military expenditures in the world, should be dealing with the insurgencies in the middle east more than us, but believes we should have a large role in helping to defend Israel. Since you probably think Ukraine is going to lead to the next world war, he thinks the US should stop spending billions to maintain bases in Europe and leave Europe to deal with Europe's problems.
I like how you miss the part where she turned over all work related or partially work related emails. The only emails the Republicans didn't get were personal emails that did not relate to her time as secretary of state. By the way if you took the time to actually read your own source you would see she acted within full accordance with the law. 
So it goes.
This is both fortunate and unfortunate. Of course, socialist Sanders shalln't win. The problem is socialism requires government power to compel the unwilling masses onto the Progressive plantation. Without coercion, without a massive state policing Progressive compliance, socialism will remain locked forever in university faculty lounges and in the dark recesses of fringe politicians. 
There are democrats who are centralists who believe in free markets. They usually just have progressive views on abortion and a few other things. I'd do more research if I were you, I am a conservative but I voted for Obama because he was the better choice. Party doesn't mean anything anymore. 
This is all regurgitated crap from the Clinton's Cash book. God forbid these reporters do an investigation on the Koch brothers and all the politicians they are buying. At least Clinton runs an amazing charity.
You go right on using holocaust terms in a scientific debate, and I'll go right on thinking you are an offensive half-wit whose opinion doesn't deserve attention. Cheers~

&gt;Bernie Sanders won't let Hillary get away with her vague populist bullshit rhetoric.  The funny thing is that her oligarch supporter, Lady Lynn de Rothschild, already told the media that Hillary will not be implementing populist solutions to wealth inequality.  I hope she gets nailed on that.  
The problem with delegating the issue to the states is that the NRA and the gun lobby don't respect those decisions either:  http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2014/11/25/nra-intends-to-lobby-against-new-background-check-law/  Washington State expanded their background check law and the NRA tried to defeat it, even after it was passed by voters. I understand that hardcore criminals will try to obtain a gun illegally, but that's no excuse to not have background checks. Going back to the credit card example, people can obtain the cards fraudulently, but that doesn't mean honest people should stoop to their level. Taken to its conclusion, we shouldn't have laws of any kind since criminals won't follow them anyway.  But I do agree with you on the desensitization of young people to death. That generation was raised on violent games, easily accessible porn and a steady diet of antidepressants, all part of a dangerous cocktail that renders them incapable of distinguishing fantasy from reality. Throw in easily accessible guns and it's a recipe for disaster.  However, I just don't see how universal background checks (whether on the state or federal level) is an abridgment of gun owners' rights. Considering that most background checks are conducted within a matter of minutes, it seems to be a minor inconvenience at best. If they pass the check, they get the gun. I just don't see why we can't have that even on a state level.
The benefits you can receive are capped, why should the amount you pay in be unlimited?
&gt; taxing the lower and lower-middle class also isn't an idyllic way...  And you said:  &gt; My problem with across the board tax cuts...  We're clearly on two different pages here.  Across the board tax cuts are pointless unless all social services are well-funded without taxpayer help. Scaling taxation, however, is a great idea pretty much all the time if your end-game is equality and well-funded services.  Wealth redistribution (either literal or in the form of infrastructure development) is the way to fix the bulk of poverty problems in our country. Fixing poverty problems fixes most of the race problems and most of the education problems. Fixing the education problems theoretically leads to a more informed and motivated populace, which fixes political problems. *Theoretically*.
Lol are you going to take solace in the fact that it's "the media's fault" when he loses?

I made my first political donation because of him. It's a recurring one as well. I really really want him to win. 
He is in no way the Ted Cruz of the left. He doesn't cynically spout half truths and untruths to pander to his base. He's been consistently fighting for the people for decades and his issues resonate across many political spectrums. Noone calls him out on lies as he seems to be honest, quite a rare quality. You can disagree with his philosophies but it's hard not to respect his honesty and dedication. He's universally loved in Vermont, the man is approachable and works for us. I'm probably biased because I lived in Vermont for a while but I also was born and raised in the South, so I've seen the 2 perspectives and know the two extremes up close and personal. All that said, I think Sanders will fight for me and the middle class, Cruz will lead us to the proverbial slaughterhouse and sell us out to the highest bidder.
By the time a politician or their staff thinks it's cool, well, lets just say the really cool kids left it behind years ago.
What a dumb fucking argument.  How many Christians live in Mecca, or Saudi Arabia?  Why would you hold the state-sanctioned Wahhabism of the KSA as some kind of universal measuring stick for the entirety of the Muslim world?
He's just in the race to make Jeb look moderate in comparison.
I agree. I think he would. I'm not knocking the man by any means. I just think he is not electable. 
Me too!
Sort of like trickle down and how if only we throw enough money at the rich we'll all somehow be better off.
Clinton has received hundreds of thousands of dollars over her career from big banks, whereas Sanders has received tens of thousands of dollars over his career from unions.
You might want to double-check the way I spelled it.  It only means one of those spelled that way.
I don't disagree with you, but police unions do not protect whistle blowers. Police unions protect nothing but police unions.   Edit: removed an extra word. 
You missed a central point. He said "Public unions" not private ones. Big difference.  Also, the majority of corruption comes from public ones, not private ones anyway.
&gt; I looked through his policies. I never saw a vote. To take away or severely control guns.  I kind of laughed you off in my other reply but being serious for a moment, that's never gonna be good enough for a GOPer.   &gt; For people constantly preaching how the two party system is a downfall  I don't do that actually. I'm open to more parties though.   &gt; You let the representatives in the media be your examples of what republican voters are.  Not sure what you're talking about here.   &gt; Time and time again you guys mention the media and how they are trying to control people.  I don't say this either, but journalism could be better. I do think there is corporate influence, and in at least one case there is outright propaganda masquerading as journalism.    
Not to get all hipster on you, but as someone who's followed Sanders a while, I agree. I'm happy Sanders has attracted such a following and I will shed tears of joy if this ends up getting him elected, but it really can scare people away.
Because the military actively tracks credit scores for security clearances. Having too many predatory loans can drum you out of the SEALS because you're a financial risk. 
Negotiations are always secret. Just look at the Iran deal. Having people try to stick their noses into negotiations while they're going on only gets mountains of bullshit and no public benefit beyond what you get just letting people see the final deal and supporting an up or down vote.
Bernie 2012
Please show me your math on that.  And no, "Rush said that" doesn't count.    There's no way that is correct.
Tell every goddamn person you know to get off their asses and vote. Don't let a single person not vote. Post on all your social media sites, email all your contacts, call your tech impaired family members, and anything else you can think of. 
[deleted]
Yeah, that's what seemed out of place to me. With AT&amp;T and Direct merging, it directly eliminates one choice from the market. If they were really opposed to this kind of stuff, this deal would be blocked. 
Police Unions are pretty damn toxic as of late. I can see why they should be curbed. Same with teachers unions. They make it so there is no accountability.
And how it's ALL obamas fault.  Every single bit of it is Barak Hussein Obamas fault.  Sometimes you just gotta throw in the Hussein to get extra credit.  Just throw some "Common Core" in there for extra extra credit for good measure too.
&gt; Clinton Cash  I was going to say this:  Is not a right wing hit piece, if find any relation between the author and the republicans I will retract my claim.  And after some goggling, the author is in fact a Republican activist, I don't know why bothered writing the book, there is a clear conflict of interest there.
I don't think Unions have ever really been associated with capitalism... The IWW, for instance, were socialist/communist. AFL-CIO has never endorsed a conservative, ever... So how would a right wing capitalist be called a "commie un-American bastard"
Christians created the atomic bomb...and used it.   There.  See how stupid you sound?
Thank you! That was the one I wanted to quote but someone recently informed of the F-22 so it was still fresh. The F-35 is a disgrace to the American people
I hope whoever is running Sanders PR campaign on Reddit gets paid well. 
[That's not entirely correct.] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/01/iraq-and-afghan-vets-are-conservative-but-theyre-not-all-republicans/) 
Running away from the original subject - typical conservative weasel response.
bernie sanders is not a socialist, he does not want to eliminate the class system and put the workers in control means of production.
Wrong. In the Spring of 2007 Obama was consistently bouncing between the high teens and the low 30's. Some polls even had him tied with or beating Clinton, most had him within single digits of her. [source](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/democratic_presidential_nomination-191.html#polls)   In contrast, Sanders is like 60 points behind Clinton, can't/won't raise serious cash, doesn't have the youth and charisma of an Obama, or the novelty/cool of being the first serious black presidential candidate.   Seriously, as a Republican I'm telling you that if you want the White House it has to be Clinton. A Biden or an O'Malley loses by at least 5%, Sanders loses by at least 10% and gets wiped in the electoral college. Look at 1964 when the Republicans nominated hardline libertarian Barry Goldwater, it would be like that in reverse.
What have Republicans done to support the troops in recent history? 
[deleted]
The 2012 GOP debates were tremendously entertaining?....
&gt; Republicans, however, clearly favor the have-much-money (investor/employer) crowd over the have-much-less-money (employee) crowd when it comes to policy decisions -- which means they clearly favor the minority over the majority.  I think they realize you cant spread the wealth if you take it from the wealthy. The lefties that vote for the democrats never say anything like that. They just continually argue they need to take more from the wealthy. And the lefties that vote democrat would simply love to rob the wealthy of everything.  Also, it's the democrats and progressives that insist on robbing the poor of wages and savings with inflation. Not to mention make entry level wages too expensive with min wage laws. Which only puts more people out of work or unemployable.  Not to mention the democrats refuse to let inner city blacks have vouchers so they can go to better schools.  When it comes down to it, the democrats and progressives hurt the poor the most. If they had their way, you would need a college degree to get a job cooking fries at McDonalds. Which is already happening under the wight of all their taxes and regulations.
That was my point. Its just data. The OP's comment attempted to draw conclusions based on it without any sort of conflating evidence. 
The ignorance feels comfortable for Wisconsin.
ITT: A lot of worried Hillary bots and shills. It's hilarious.   Or Hillarious, depending.
&gt; When the Dems rolled out Wall St. fellating, Republican in sheep's clothing Hillary  Thank you for providing a perfect teachable example of vote splitting in FPTP electoral systems, AKA why Sanders running will make it much, much more likely that we end up with a Republican president.
that's related to the fact that he has low name recognition, whereas hillary has 99% name recognition
He is a socialist from arguably the most liberal state in the entire country which is also one of the smallest and least nationally important states in politics. Consequently, he has no national name recognition and a small donor base. If he does get his message out it will alienate at least one (probably more) voters for every one he intrigues, and those he alienates mostly reside in demographic groups that are more statistically likely to vote than the ones he appeals to. As much as he doesn't want to admit it, his race is a novelty, the manifestation of a populist streak of liberalism that is currently in vogue (These rise every 25-30 years in the country before petering out). It will be dead after the first round of primaries.
Yes, sort of. But it is important to know that Vermont politics is retail politics.  Bernie has probably met or spoken to more than half of the voters in Vermont. We are a small state, and Bernie is tireless. (Maybe the Feds should look into whether a cyborg is eligible)   Bernie (and Jane) walk in the 4th of July parade in a town near me. He opens up agricultural fairs and new bridges. He'll come to your graduation if he has an afternoon to spare. As somebody else said, "He'd come to the opening of an envelope".   So anybody in Vermont who wants to talk to Bernie... has already talked to Bernie. The man is hard to avoid, jeesh.  Socialist? Whaazzat? Oh, Bernie? &lt;laughs&gt; He's a good guy. He can call himself a socialistista all he wants.
The Bernie spam is annoying.
I understand your point but shouldn't all job pay increase as cost of living increases?  And if technology has made the job of a manager simpler shouldn't that make the manger more easily replaceable and less skilled?  Also what about skilled laborers such as electricians, plumbers, hvac workers, there pay scales have not been increasing even tho they are skilled workers?
Yes, but I have a few friends that work in physician's offices. They do not take this insurance with it's new level of negotiated rates. It has resulted in these offices scaling back. 
And.... he still can't win. He says the right words but doesn't say them well and doesn't look presidential while saying them. He's an incredibly weak candidate. Warren was the progressive candidate and she's not running. I expect her to use the bully pulpit to influence on the primaries though.
Oh, hey there, Goldman Sachs!
How much of a child do you have to be to believe this shit?
Have fun with your nine readers!
In my opinion (and again this is only a biased opinion but I think it is reasonable one), that has to do with people being more likely to buy into the system when they have more of a stake in it. People who are wealthier pay more in taxes, therefore they care more about tax increases/cuts, fiscal policy, etc. This wealthier group also tends to be more conservative and older. Fear of losing what one has is a more powerful motivating force than the possibility of gaining something new for younger, poorer, and more liberal groups.   This is of course a broad overgeneralization, but look at voter participation stats from this nation's history, the wider the franchise becomes the more it drops. It has, with some fluctuations, dropped by more than 20 points over the last century.
It begins, first earthquakes and now this
But it's just a mouth. No real substance. What good does it do if Hillary comes out hard against corporate money and the banks if she doesn't govern that way. Obama talks a great game too. What happened there?
2-Butoxyethanol is used in all sorts of stuff including cosmetics, household cleaning products and as an approved food additive.  It was also only detected in parts per trillion.  Ridiculous fear mongering.  There is no reason to believe that it even came from fracking. 
Yep. He says blind rage stuff without even having a reasoned argument. He communicates poorly to anyone but those who already think the same way (which is by far a minority in the country) and looks like shit while he does it. His candidacy looks like it's powered by his massive ego.  I'm seriously disappointed in Reddit's lack of critical judgement on this primary.
That sounds like a stupid thing to do.  &gt; Republican  Well, makes sense then.
Are you trying to buy his vote with fake internet points?
&gt;...free trade policies for countries are decoupled with the income inequality question.  That's simply not true and the money trail disproves your theory.  &gt;Comparative advantage is real.  This isn't true either.  Comparative advantage is a just another in a LONG line of supply side-centric economic theories that have been disproven by U.S. economic history.  &gt;Inequality is fostered by higher returns on capital than economic growth.  By all means, go ahead and explain why in much greater detail.  You stopped before you fully explained the reasons.  &gt;You can have a more egalitarian society by having robust public finance with low barriers to trade  U.S. Free Trade history has disproven this theory beyond all shadow of doubt since U.S. society has become FAR less egalitarian post-Free Trade.  &gt;...foreign countries are essentially like robots producing goods or any other productivity enhancement.  Foreign workers and foreign countries deserve to enjoy the same human rights as the American people.  Exploiting any worker as though their humanity doesn't matter is evidence that the business community hasn't learned a damned thing after fostering slavery around the world.  &gt;Those also foster economic growth also, but also foster income and wealth inequality in the absence of robust public finance.  What are you trying to say here?  You lost me. 
I need to save this comment so the next time this comes up I don't have to bother you for this pile of shit to be refuted.
Well, you aren't wrong. 
I've been having fun arguing with this Renner1 guy. He's extremely nasty and is very cagey about what he actually thinks.
[deleted]
Or more likely, the fact that he calls himself a socialist.
Not if you read the article. (Maybe that's setting the bar a bit high for /r/politics though)
I told you why he wouldn't win. He doesn't have general election appeal. The guy is an angry progressive. Angry progressives don't get into the white house. Sweet talking one's will sometimes if the conditions are right but they sure as hell aren't right now.  He would get destroyed. I wish it was possible for him to win the primary just so I could show you how foolish you are.  Ya'll liberals on reddit need to come out of your ivory towers occasionally to notice the rest of the country.
You seem to be confusing Bernie Sanders with Ron Paul.  The Fed and "the big banks" (I'm sure you mean Goldman Sachs, AIG, etc) are entirely different entities.
He is a socialist though, even he will tell you that.
In fact: &gt; The authors said the amount found, which was measured in parts per trillion, was within safety regulations and did not pose a health risk.  And that was found in only 1 sample. So, yeah, nothing to see here. 
HA!  Not going to hold you to if if you can't afford it, money gets tight sometimes.

Heres a brilliant [idea](http://i.imgur.com/h9Qcwir.jpg)
You're relying on the incorrect assumption that people change their minds in modern elections.  They don't.  Instead, they decide whether or not they will bother with voting at all.  Modern elections are about motivating voters, not changing minds.  Democrat-leaning voters don't decide to vote Republican, and Republican-leaning voters don't decide to vote Democrat.  For instance, in the lead-up 2012, a mere 6% of voters entertained the possibility that their minds could be changed according to a Washington Post poll.  What's more, Bernie's not "too liberal for America."  Bernie Sanders can excite younger, more liberal voters (who wouldn't normally vote);  Hillary Clinton cannot.  Older, more moderate voters will far more reliably show up to the polls to vote democrat no matter what.  So, Bernie will attract young voters, which has a big impact on elections since they don't normally vote, and he won't scare off any significant number of older, more moderate voters.  You "centrists" need to join the rest of us in 2016.  The 90s are done.
When was that?  Sorry, but I give 0 fucks about the corporatist Ron Paul.
That is why I don't want to just get behind Sanders.  I want to see who else steps up to the plate behind him to run for Congress; I want to vote and hype candidates he endorses and who endorse him. 
Females.
obama didn't have a republican congress in 2008 when he was elected. the democrats controlled congress in 2006 and actually *expanded* their control in 2008 elections.  additionally, because bernie and joe lieberman caucused with the democrats, the democrats had control of senate by 2 seats going into 2008 elections, and again *expanded* control (58-41). during the first two years of obama's presidency, the democrats controlled both houses and the executive office.  if obama had pushed the agenda on which he was elected, he would have gotten what he promised us. instead, he got what he asked for, which is why we need a man like bernie, who will fight for us.
Fuck you too Scott Walker.
Are you suggesting that he secretly wants to tax everyone at 50%, even the average income earner?  Yes, he may want the US to be more like Denmark but that doesn't mean he want the US to be exactly the same either.
Yes, the problem with people carrying death machines is that those same people don't spend a day each week listening to someone tell them stories from a book that advocates killing people who don't believe it.
A little bit of knowledge is dangerous.
Got a lot of cops.
If you support him then you should also believe in him. And don't say that people are crazy for thinking single payer is inevitable. Inevitable doesn't mean 2016, or 2056, but it does mean that it is guaranteed to happen in the future, which it is. 
*The open group unfunded obligation for OASDI over the 75-year period is $10.6 trillion in present value and is $1.0 trillion more than the measured level of $9.6 trillion a year ago.*  http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2014/tr2014.pdf
He's not governor of my state nor is he president or VP or even a Member of the US Congress -- so Jack Markell, and any delusions he, individually, may have is not my problem.  "Even today, with plenty of jobs and wealth being created again, the altered economic terrain is preventing new wealth from being broadly shared."   The current economic terrain IS a huge part of what George HW Bush rightly called "voodoo economics" -- the rules are being made to favor corporate America without regard to adverse consequences to the employee class or the consumer class or, for that matter, to the nation's economic well being in our now largely consumer driven economy.    The referenced "pi$$ on you policies" designed to maximize profits for the investor class, including by stagnating wages via any means possible, is at the very core of the ever widening wealth/income gap that is decreasing what consumers can actually pay for without putting it on credit, something that serves primarily the interest of the financial industry.  Though I've never been a union member, I do remember the Reagan push to crush the unions, including not only firing federal workers that tried to strike but also the first amnesty for illegals, opening the floodgates to illegals ( reportedly 47 million of them now) in order to keep competition for lesser skilled jobs high and wages for them low.  Neither democrats nor republicans seem to have any interest in going after EMPLOYERS that hire illegals who often will work for cash and for less "off book", off SS matching tax lists, off unemployment compensation lists and seemingly willing to disregard any workplace  hazards, the correction of which would cost employers -- and every other "benefit" for which jobs are being sent overseas to foreign workers.  Add to that technology replacing people in repetitive, lesser skilled jobs.  Ad to that the built in head start the children of the wealthiest families have in beginning the economic rat race which seems to grow exponentially with each generation, in no small part because of the ever increasing higher cost of education.  Now you begin to have a clearer view of the "altered" economic reality and the policies that created it are the pro big business anti employee class tax and trade policies of trickle down economics.     
Dude leave out your first sentence next time. You aren't a conservative or a republican if you agree with even 15% of his platform. Seriously quit pandering for up votes.

nah man. He's gonna make a huge impact, because that's all reddit has talked about for days /s
&gt; No you brought up mitts tax rate,  Right.   His tax rates are low because of off-shoring his money and because of carried interest.  Has nothing to do with corporate taxes.  &gt; This is the rate Romney pays on his income after donations to charities.   The church.   I'm sure you can find many people to change the topic to corporate tax rates, but not me.
Why can't you do all that for yourself? It seems risky putting all that responsibility in the hands of one person, who so happens to a politician, no less.  Will he end the Fed?
"It was also only detected in parts per trillion."  Oh, well then let's just keep doing it and see what happens. 
Why would millionaires want to pay into an insurance program they can't benefit from? Social Security is supposed to be a retirement and disability plan you pay in to and receive later in life. It's not a redistribution program aimed at taxing everyone without paying out to everyone eventually.  Bernie is admitting what many Democrats haven't wanted to acknowledge for a long time, which is that Social Security *needs* to be modified.
The U.S. doesn't prosecute any of its military for war crimes and likely never will.  The defendant Soldiers gets charged with UCMJ violations.  So Ben was partially right, but broken clocks are right some of the time.
Your points are absurd.   First, that the chemical is in cleaning products or food additives is irrelevant. Unless someone is pouring cleaning chemicals into the ground deep enough to contaminate three separate wells, the most likely source is still fracking.  That the levels are within safe limits is also an invalid point. The problem is that there isn't supposed to be *any* contamination of drinking water. The whole rationale for fracking is that the chemicals are injected so deep into the ground that it cannot rise to the shallow aquifer strata. That's why the energy companies are able to use pretty much whatever they want without regard for regulations.   The presence of fracking fluid in well water exponentially increases the total cost of extraction.   
Did any of those angry Christians make good on their anonymous letters from the 80s? 
&gt; That is over 75 years  Exactly. Do you understand discount rates and discounted cash flow analysis? If you don't understand these economic concepts or basic pension accounting, you might not understand the magnitude of what that "unfunded obligation over 75-years" really means.
Damn right.
Yeah, in Texas there are no unions and they still have tenured teachers that literally don't care anymore because they cannot be fired.
How do you figure? He's a great candidate, not a career politician and he will pull in the black and guilt vote. He's like Obama but with life experience and better value system. 
I know this is r/politics and I know it's not entirely your fault, but the fact that he keeps showing up on the front page of r/all sort of convinces me he is fucked.
I saw a story just today that argues he doesn't have to win to build a progressive movement. I'll see if I can find that link.
&gt; So please, tell me why I shouldn't hold the opinion of a former Secretary of Labor as more insightful and important than that of the Redditor saying Reich sounds retarded or the Redditor saying Huffington Compost without a dose of irony?   A) That's 100% an appeal to authority, not a great argument.  B) The negotiations are secret, so there's no way for Reich to know what's even in the agreement.
If Bernie doesn't win, that $20 worth of time will be about 2.5 hours.
I'm curious:   Does this mean we should privatize social security?   Should we provide vouchers for people that do not want to attend public school?   What about all the deregulation that has happened in Sweden?  Is that what president Bernie Sanders wants?   What about private healthcare?  the government promoting private health insurance?  Private emergency rooms?  Hospitals on the stock market?    What about privatizing public-transportation?   Does Bernie really want the US to be more like Scandinavia?   My hunch is he actually has no clue what is going on in Sweden - but if he does he gets my vote. 
Not at all. Carried interest is a very legitimate form of income and taxed appropriately as capital gains.  Although it is hilarious to see you bringing out the broken and false liberal talking point about PE.  PS why no response to the bit on corporate income being a part of capital gains? Why no response to the charity piece?  Any more broken and false liberal talking points about carried interest, PE, or rich people to trot out?
oh look, another article about Bernie Sanders. 
They aren't direct competitors because they've colluded and drawn out territories. Other telecoms are involved in this collusion. 
Part per trillion is quite a low concentration. 
Well good thing he will never get elected president. I can't say that how does Wisconsin repeatability elect this retard to office when my own state kept electing Michelle Bachman.
No, Obama was polling around 20% at this point in 08. Bernie is too old, not charismatic, and won't raise enough money to make a difference in the primary. 
I can't freaking stand unions. I hate that they force people to join them, only to promise them "higher salaries" that take all of the added money you get and give it to - guess who - the union leaders. I'm a freaking individual, I can make my own demands and choices.  I think they have every right to exist, but I can't stand them and am happy I'm in a right-to-work state, and there's a reason why our economies are flourishing and our inflation is lower.
any amount is ridiculous and shouldn't be there.
Compared to socialist western Europe?  Sure.  Of course .. they have lost their control to print funny money.
&gt; I can say, beyond a "hunch" that he knows a lot about Scandinavia.  Your hunch is wrong.  Everything I listed has occurred in Sweden since the socialist induced crash of the 90's.  If his positions contradict the points I made - but he still wants to "be more like Scandinavia" - then he's a moron.  I think the trigger word was "Sweden" - but it was for you, not me.
There is evidence to suggest that the currently purposed  measures will do little to halt global warming as it ignores China and India.
Okay, then don't call what Charlie Hebdo does free speech either. Yes, I'm _assuming_ here, but it's probably a fair assumption.
Now and again, I make sure to remind my friends who didn't vote in 2012 how dumb that choice was.  I was shocked when I asked my 6 closest friends, only one had voted in 2012.  (I'll be voting in my first presidential primary, assuming the race is still going by then. Who knows, Bernie might have sealed the deal by the time my state is set to vote)

What if I told you, that income inequality is at the worst levels since the Gilded Age aka the 19th century? 
Of course they have no evidence. That's the whole point of using a foundation to receive donations, now, isn't it?
The only media I have is Reddit. I barely read /r/news at that. I think I come in /r/politics like three times a year. Don't read the papers, don't watch TV (literally, ever, Netflix or bust), don't talk to coworkers about these things. So yes, the burden is on Sanders to reach out to us. Otherwise, he's just another shit politician who doesn't mean anything to me and I certainly wouldn't waste my time going to polls to vote for ANY of them. He isn't fighting the other politicians, he's fighting a general distrust of ALL politicians.
Charlie Hebdo doesn't hold events in the name of free speech that have guys who want to ban the Koran as the keynote speaker. If you support suppression with one hand while trying to carry the free speech banner with the other, you deserve to be called out on it.
Can an actor who starred in movies with monkeys become president?
Shit tastic article.

Bet ol Pamela creamed her jeans when she heard the news. 
The US has some major, major problems with how we handle science, but we (sadly) don't have many serious competitors.   The EU has massively slashed science funding since the financial crisis.  Germany is really the only country that's held even.    Russia is fucking broke, they're not funding fundamental science in a significant way.  China is rising, but they have a long, long way to go before they'd be ready to compete with the US.  It's not just money, it's the culture of innovation and freedom of thought.  Autocratic societies have a really hard time with innovation.    The Soviets juggled their scientists around in a lot of creative ways to give them enough freedom to be innovative while not contaminating the culture as a whole, but I don't know if it could work in the modern world.  You'd probably see a revolution in China first.      
As if the democrats weren't playing at social engineering enough, reddit want's a progressive in office. For fucks sake. Have you seen the SJW crazies that have coopted the progressive movement? You might as well elect a straight up Marxist.
You're aware that you're casting two crazy dudes as the representatives of a whole religion right now? And then we're going to get into the regular routine of comparing people murdered in the name of one religion to another, or can we just skip past that and agree that its just not the most relevant or useful variable for analyzing the equation when there are a plethora of other explanatory factors available?
1 - What is the reason why we are not allowed to put our own misleading title in posts we make in r/politics? We allow shitty "news sources" that use misleading/completely wrong titles. Whats the difference? One is some random Reddit and the other could be just any guy with a blog.  2 - Walker didn't "say" anything of the sort. Saying He "said" anything close to what the title leads on is just fucked up. I don't care what your political side is, but we should all be able to agree that this shit is annoying and only leads to shitty circle jerk comments.   3 - He only wants "right to work" to become federal law. And it should. You guys realize that we made closed shops illegal, right? We made it illegal for someone to have to join a union to work somewhere. So tell me how being required to be a member of a union and being required to pay fees to it is different.  When unions becoming collective bargaining representatives by receiving over 50% support from the employees, they take control of ALL the employees bargaining rights. This is why unions must still provide benefits to employees in "right to work" states even if they don't pay. Because if they didn't, the employee still wouldn't be able to try and get any benefits for themselves.  Unions are FREE to not be exclusive bargaining agents. They can legally be member only unions. Thereby only needing to represent employees that are members that pay them a membership fee. NOW there are our course reason why unions don't do this. Why only allow people that want to be in the union when you have a law that requires ALL employees to pay to you while also having the power over what these employees while be paid.   This of course hurts unions, as it reduces their power and their income. That's obvious. But I can't justify why this should be law in the first place. Why should a hard working employee working somewhere for 20 years that doesn't want to be in union, be forced to pay union dues or quit when a union comes in as a collective bargaining agent?   **Why is forcing union membership illegal, but forcing union payment legal?**   And I reiterate again that unions ARE NOT forced to give benefits to "free-riders". That is the choice of a union when they become a collective bargaining representative.  I'm asking for responses. I truly want to know why you think this is right. I don't want you to point to statistics of lower wages (etc.) as I can point to statistics of less unemployment. What I want to know if why you think an entity (union) should be able to gain 50%+ of the employee population vote, TAKE ALL of the employees bargaining rights, and then REQUIRE that they pay for that representation.
